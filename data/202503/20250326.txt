1	3/26/2025	East deals. Should East open the bidding?	Yes, 1H. East has to pick between 1H, 2H and 3H. The hand is a little too strong for the preempts. East has only 6 LTC, plus the Bergen 20. She should take the more aggressive path.	20250326_1.png
2	3/26/2025	Bidding: 1H. Should South overcall?	Yes, Double. South surely needs to bid here. 2D would promise 6 Diamonds or 5 with 3 honors.  The Takeout Double will let Partner announce her best not-Hearts suit.	20250326_1.png
3	3/26/2025	Bidding: 1H, X. What should West bid, if anything?	Redouble! West should show her strength. The redouble shows 10+ HCP. It denies Heart support (she would just raise Hearts if she had 3+ of them). West does not have a suit to bid, but the Takeout Double has given her a chance to describe her hand perfectly.	20250326_1.png
4	3/26/2025	Bidding: 1H, X, XX. What will North do?	Bid 1S. North is obligated by the Takeout Double to show her best suit. North does not want her side to defend 1H doubled and redoubled!	20250326_1.png
5	3/26/2025	Bidding: 1H, X, XX, 1S. What will East bid now?	2H. Playing SAYC, the redouble is 1-round forcing. East will show her Heart length and minimum opening strength.	20250326_1.png
6	3/26/2025	Bidding: 1H, X, XX, 1S, 2H. South will Pass, as North may only have 4 Spades and almost no HCP. What should West bid now?	3H. East has promised 6+ Hearts so the fit is there. With the ♥A and ♥J and 11 HCP, West can invite to game.	20250326_1.png
7	3/26/2025	Bidding: 1H, X, XX, 1S, 2H, P, 3H, P. Should East Pass or go to game?	4H. The 7th Heart gives East just enough push to try the game contract.	20250326_1.png
8	3/26/2025	All Pass. 4H in the West. What should West lead first?	♥Q. OK, generally, don't lead a singleton trump. But, from the bidding, South knows her Partner is almost bare. So, any of the side-suits would surely help the Declarer. At least the ♥Q might not cost the defense anything.	20250326_1.png
9	3/26/2025	After seeing the opening lead and Dummy, how should East plan the play?	East knows all the high cards are in the South. It looks like 2 Spades losers, the ♠A, and a Club for down 1. But can she make South start a side suit? South will lead out 7 rounds of trump, and watch South's discards.	20250326_1.png
10	3/26/2025	Does 4H make?	Yes. South will likely discard down to 2 of each Spades, Diamonds and Clubs. East will throw South in with Spades. South may take 2 Spades and the ♦A but will have to give up the last 3 tricks.	20250326_1.png

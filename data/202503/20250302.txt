1	3/2/2025	Should North open with this sketchy hand?	Yes, 1D. There are 12 HCP and a quality 5-card suit.  True, the ♣Q is of dubious value. LTC=7 and Bergen 20 = 21. These are opening values.  North might pass with 12 HCP and no 5-card suit but that's not the case here.	20250302_1.png
2	3/2/2025	Bidding: 1D. East will Pass.  How should South respond?	1H. South has openers opposite openers, so must choose something forcing.  A 4-card major is OK for 1-over-1, and we bid up-the-line with nearly equal Hearts and Spades.	20250302_1.png
3	3/2/2025	Bidding: 1D, P, 1H.  West will Pass.  What is the recommended rebid by North.	2H. A fit, Happiness! Partner has at least 4 Hearts. 2H shows a minimum opener (12-15 HCP).  The ♣Q looks a little better as a singleton with a trump fit.	20250302_1.png
4	3/2/2025	Bidding: 1D, P, 1H, P, 2H, P,  What should responder's rebid be?	3NT.  South tells Partner that 1) they have strength for game, 2) there is nothing extra in Hearts, 3) there are stoppers in the black suits, and 4) the hand is balanced.	20250302_1.png
5	3/2/2025	Bidding: 1D, P, 1H, P, 2H, P,  3NT, P. What should North say now?	4H. The value of this hand dips back down in NT, as North has no interest in trying those black suits in NT.  South will have to try to make do with the 4-4 Heart fit.	20250302_1.png
6	3/2/2025	All Pass.  4H in the South.  What is the best opening lead for West?	♠K. West would start with the 2♣ against NT, but the top of a 2-card honor sequence is a recommended start versus a suit contract.  	20250302_1.png
7	3/2/2025	How should South plan the play to make 10 tricks?	It looks grim for Declarer.  She is missing the ♥Q and ♥J, so losing a trump, a Club, and 2 Spades. The only hope is to throw Spades on Diamonds, if the defense allows it.  Also, trump has to split 3-2 for there to be any chance.	20250302_1.png
8	3/2/2025	What should Declarer play after the opening lead of the King of Spades?	♠A, then the Ace and King of trump. That will leave E/W with the one high trump.  Hopefully, they won't want to spend it on a Diamond ruff.  Continue with ♦K and the ♦J, overtaking with the Dummy's ♦Q. Lead the ♦T.	20250302_1.png
9	3/2/2025	How does East figure whether or not to spend her high trump on the Ten of Diamonds?	East could think that it would be nice to make Declarer lead trump and spend 2 trumps to force out her 1.  But, it is clear that the defense is going to get just 1 Heart trick and 1 Club and no Diamonds.  It's 2 Spade tricks or the bid makes. East can't let Spades be thrown on good Diamonds. Trump now!	20250302_1.png
10	3/2/2025	East plays her trump and leads 2 rounds of Spades. Does the contract make?	No, down one. South took the best line of play, but no joy.  N/S did everything right, but the best of contracts don't make sometimes.	20250302_1.png

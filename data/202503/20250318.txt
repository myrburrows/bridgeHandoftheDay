1	3/18/2025	South deals. What should South open?	1H. South has a minimum-range opener, but all systems are go: HCP, LTC, and Bergen 20.	20250318_1.png
2	3/18/2025	Bidding: 1H. West will Pass with no 5-card suit. What should North respond?	3H. North's hand is a classic "limit raise". It is a non-forcing suit raise, that promises 4 Hearts and "just short of opening". North would say 2H if a little weaker, and 2NT (game forcing "Jacoby 2NT") with a couple more HCP. 3H is just right.	20250318_1.png
3	3/18/2025	Bidding: 1H, P, 3H. West will Pass. What should South rebid?	Pass. Partner is inviting game if there is anything extra. South can't really find enough. There is the doubleton, but trump aren't great and the black Kings may or may not work out. If other pairs bid 4 and make, well - good on 'em. North's bid is called limit raise for a reason.	20250318_1.png
4	3/18/2025	All Pass. 3H in the South. What should West choose for the opening lead?	♣3. Sadly, there is no good choice. West will never lead trump, and doesn't want to help declarer with the other side suits. So, pick a Club. "4th down" isn't really a thing against a suit contract, but what can she do?	20250318_1.png
5	3/18/2025	After Dummy comes down, how should Declarer plan the play?	South looks at 2 Diamond losers and a Club, plus maybe a trump and maybe a Spade. She will plan to get to Dummy early, and try the Heart finesse. After that, pull trump, clear Clubs and lead Diamonds toward the Q-J. Maybe a Diamond trick will develop and maybe a helpful Spade lead will come.	20250318_1.png
6	3/18/2025	West takes the ♣A and returns Clubs. Declarer takes in Dummy and leads the ♥2. The finesse fails and West takes the ♥K and returns Clubs. Now what?	The defense has 2 tricks and still has ♦A and ♦K. Declarer needs to finesse the ♠Q or sluff a Spade. South leads the ♥A and both missing trump fall. She leads a small Diamond. If West has the A-K or if the A-K are split (75%), she can toss a Spade on the good Diamond.	20250318_1.png
7	3/18/2025	On the 4♦ lead, West plays low. South plays the ♦J from Dummy and East takes the King. She leads the ♠3. Now what?	Thanks for nothing! Declarer will take the better chance in Diamonds and play the ♠K. She leads the ♦6 and the ♦A appears from West. Next, the Spade loser goes onto the ♦Q.	20250318_1.png
8	3/18/2025	Does the contract make?	Yes. 3H was challenging enough.	20250318_1.png

1	3/5/2025	West is the dealer. Should West open the bidding?	1S. West has just enough HCP.  West also has only 6 LTC, plus 5-5 distribution.  There is strength in "5-5, come alive". Open the higher ranking of 2 equal suits.	20250305_1.png
2	3/5/2025	Bidding: 1S. What overcall should North make?	2S. Playing SAYC, this is the Michaels Cuebid convention. It is briefly "the other major and a minor" -- a 2-suiter, at least 5-5.  It is obviously forcing on South. 	20250305_1.png
3	3/5/2025	Bidding: 1S, 2S. East will Pass with not enough to interfere at 3S. How should South advance?	3C. This bid shows a nothing-special hand with 4+ Clubs. South would bid 2NT to show no preference for Hearts or either minor.  2NT here would not show any strength.	20250305_1.png
4	3/5/2025	Bidding: 1S, 2S, P, 3C. Can West bid again?	3D. The opponents are bidding West's short suits. Maybe E/W can find a fit in Diamonds or Spades,  Partner can pass or return to Spades if North passes.	20250305_1.png
5	3/5/2025	Bidding: 1S, 2S, P, 3C, 3D. What should North do?	5C. Even if Partner only bid because she had to, there should be a play for 11 tricks.	20250305_1.png
6	3/5/2025	All Pass. 5C in the South.  What is West's opening lead?	â™£6. West is afraid of costing the defense a trick in any of the side suits.  Draining a trump is unlikely to hurt anything and may disrupt a cross-trump by the Declarer.	20250305_1.png
7	3/5/2025	Trumps are led. What is the plan of play for the Declarer?	South plans to draw trump, then see about the Hearts.  She only needs 1) Clubs to split 2-1, 2) West to hold the Ace of Hearts, and 3) Hearts to break no worse than 4-2.  	20250305_1.png
8	3/5/2025	Does Declarer make the game in Clubs?	Yes, all 3 of of the things needed follow normality.  Defenders only get 2 Aces.  The fifth Heart in North is the 11th trick.	20250305_1.png

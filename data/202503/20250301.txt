1	3/1/2025	Should South open 2NT?	No.  South has the HCP, and the stoppers and no 5-card suit.  It is "legal" in ACBL play to open NT with a singleton Ace.  2NT is defensible, but lying about shape to most partners invites doom. Honesty is its own reward.	20250301_1.png
2	3/1/2025	How should South open the bidding?	1C.  This is a very strong hand but not quite the right size or shape for 2C or 2NT.  Open 1C to make it easy, but not mandatory, for North to respond.	20250301_1.png
3	3/1/2025	Bidding: 1C. West will pass.  Should North bid something beside Pass?	1D. Even playing "standard" minors, 1C could be a lot of different things. North wants to get a 6-card suit in the mix, even light on HCP. North can rebid 2D if South rebids 1H, 1S, or 1NT (which is likely).	20250301_1.png
4	3/1/2025	Bidding: 1C, P, 1D. East will pass. What should South rebid?	3NT.  Partner has not told South much, but 6-9 HCP anywhere should be enough.  North will usually have 4+ Diamonds so the singleton risk is somewhat limited.	20250301_1.png
5	3/1/2025	All Pass. 3NT in the South.  What is the opening lead from West?	Jack of Hearts.  It is the top of a series in an unbid suit.  It is an easy choice.	20250301_1.png
6	3/1/2025	How should South plan the play?	It is not great.  Declarer has 8 tricks off the top, and only 1 suit to possibly develop.  That's Dummy's Diamonds, opposite the singleton Ace.  There are entries to Dummy in Clubs so South can give it a try.	20250301_1.png
7	3/1/2025	South will take the Ace of Hearts, unblock the Ace of Diamonds, take the Ace of Clubs and lead the Queen. Then what?	South can get to Dummy 3 times by overtaking the Queen (assuming the Club ten behaves).  If Diamonds split 3-3 or (in a likely 4-2 split) the King or Queen is doubleton, Dummy's last Diamond will be good.	20250301_1.png
8	3/1/2025	Declarer plays the King of Clubs on the Queen and East shows out.  The ten is onside.  Which Diamond should be led?	D3. The Diamonds will setup only if 3-3 or a high honor is doubleton.  The King falls, and West will lead another Heart.  Declarer takes and leads toward the J-9 of Clubs.  A high Diamond now knocks out the Queen.	20250301_1.png
9	3/1/2025	Does Declarer make the 3NT contract?	Yes.  East will take the Queen of Diamonds, and the defense will get 2 Heart tricks (assuming East unblocks).  But, with careful handling of Clubs and Diamonds, South gets 4 Clubs, 2 Hearts, the Spade Ace, and the critical 2 Diamonds.	20250301_1.png

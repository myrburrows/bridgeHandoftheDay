1	3/7/2025	South deals and picks up a huge hand.  What should she open?	2NT. South has a balanced hand and 21 HCP.  It is the definition of a 2NT opener. In fact, it is too balanced (3-3-3-4), and we subtract a point for that weak distribution. 	20250307_1.png
2	3/7/2025	Bidding: 2NT. West cannot overcall at the 3-level, and will Pass.  What should North's response be?	3NT. North has no 4+-card major suit. With 5 HCP to go with Partner's 20-21, there is a game-going total.	20250307_1.png
3	3/7/2025	All Pass. 3NT in the South. What is the recommended opening lead for West?	♥Q. It is the top of a 5-card honor sequence.  West will hope to knock out any Heart stoppers, and run the rest.	20250307_1.png
4	3/7/2025	How should South plan the play?	Declarer should count winners in NT contracts.  South sees 1 Spade, 2 Hearts, 1 Diamond and 4 Clubs. Where to find trick #9?	20250307_1.png
5	3/7/2025	Which suit offers the only real opportunity for South to find the extra trick?	Spades. If East has the King and Queen, or if the King and Queen are split, then South can finesse Spades twice for an extra trick.  It is only about 25% that West will have both King and Queen, so odds for success of the double finesse is almost 75%	20250307_1.png
6	3/7/2025	What is the glaring problem with this strategy?	There is only one apparent entry to Dummy, the Ace of Clubs. Another entry can be developed if Declarer holds on to the ♣2. This will work if Clubs split 3-2 in E/W. That's about a 67% likelihood.	20250307_1.png
7	3/7/2025	How will the play go?	Declarer will take the opening Heart, and cross to the ♣A with the ♣10. From Dummy, a small Spade to the ten. That is covered by the King. West leads Hearts, taken by Declarer. Then it is the King and Queen of Clubs, and then the ♣2 over to the ♣7. Another small Spade, and the Queen is finessed.	20250307_1.png
8	3/7/2025	Does the contract make?	Yes, 4 Clubs, 2 Hearts, 1 Diamond and 2! Spades.	20250307_1.png

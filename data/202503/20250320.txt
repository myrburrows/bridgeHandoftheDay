1	3/20/2025	East deals, Pass. How should South start the bidding?	1D. South has opening HCP count, weak LTC and OK "Bergen 20". South has a minimum opener. She has no major suit and not enough for NT. Playing "standard minors", it is nothing special. For an opening hand, bid the higher ranking of equal suits.	20250320_1.png
2	3/20/2025	Bidding: P, 1D. Should West enter the bidding?	No, Pass. Double would not be understood by Partner. 2D (not playing "Michaels" in the minors) would say "I was about to open 1D". West has a good hand, but not quite openers. She heard South promise 4 Diamonds, too.	20250320_1.png
3	3/20/2025	Bidding: P, 1D, P. How should North respond?	1S. North is happy to get her 6-card Spades into the auction. 1S promises 6+ HCP (unlimited), 4 or more Spades, and is forcing for 1 round.	20250320_1.png
4	3/20/2025	Bidding: P, 1D, P. 1S, P. How should South rebid?	2S. South understands that Partner may have only 4 Spades. There is no better option for her. Pass is out, 2D would promise 6, and she should not start Clubs at the 2-level with 4. 1NT is considered but Hearts are not there. Axx of Spades is something, so 2S is best.	20250320_1.png
5	3/20/2025	Bidding: P, 1D, P. 1S, P, 2S, P. How should North rebid?	4S. North will add 5 points for the void. Now there is game-going, opener across from opener. Partner supported North's rebiddable suit. "She who knows, goes", so no half-measures.	20250320_1.png
6	3/20/2025	All Pass. 4S in the North. What is East's opening lead?	♠J. All of the side-suits are uninviting. With a silent partner and no safe passive lead, East will try to reduce ruffing opportunities for Declarer. Rather than starting th 6♠, the Jack might disrupt the trump play. If Declarer has A-K-Q in trump, spending the doubleton J6 won't hurt the defense anyway.	20250320_1.png
7	3/20/2025	How should North plan the play?	North sees 1 Spade loser, 1 Heart and 1 Club. She has to be careful not to lose a second Club on a possible 4th round. She wants to ruff a Heart in Dummy before pulling trump, The ♠J lead guarantees a max of 1 Spade loser.	20250320_1.png
8	3/20/2025	Declarer plays the ♠A first, but the ♠K does not fall. She will lead the ♥A and another Heart. What's next?	West will be in, but can really do no harm. She will take the ♠K to cut the trump in Dummy to 1. West will likely lead the ♥Q next, hoping declarer has 2 small ones left. That will be trumped in Dummy. The ♦A will be played, pitching a Club.	20250320_1.png
9	3/20/2025	Does Declarer make her 10 tricks?	Yes. North just loses one in trumps, one in Hearts and the ♣A.	20250320_1.png

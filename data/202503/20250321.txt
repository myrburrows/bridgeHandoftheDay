1	3/21/2025	East deals. Should East open the bidding?	No, Pass. In "first chair", East is too light to open 1D. East considers 2D, but the Weak-2 standard is "2 of top 3, or 3 of top 5". With the singleton and good Hearts, the hand is a bit strong for a preempt anyway.	20250321_1.png
2	3/21/2025	Bidding: P. South will Pass. Should West open?	Yes, 1S. "Third hand, bid if you can". West is just short on all counts. But, in third chair and not vulnerable, the strong Spades push to open.	20250321_1.png
3	3/21/2025	Bidding: P, P, 1S. North will Pass. How should East respond?	3D. If East bids (2D non-forcing), after the initial pass, it shows 10-11 HCP and rebiddable Diamonds. East wants to show a little extra and invite Partner to 3NT if it's sensible. Her bid is like the 1NT-3D invitation, and counting on Partner to understand.	20250321_1.png
4	3/21/2025	Bidding: P, P, 1S, P, 3D, P. How should West rebid?	3NT. If she understands East correctly, there should be 6 Diamond tricks plus some decent cards on the side. With the ♠A, West should have a chance of finagling 2 more tricks somewhere.	20250321_1.png
5	3/21/2025	Bidding: P, P, 1S, P, 3D, P, 3NT, All Pass. 3NT in the West. How should North start the defense?	5♣. It is maybe arguable but, versus NT, North should not lead the top of a 2-card honor sequence. North starts 4th down and hopes to run Clubs when the defense gets back on lead.	20250321_1.png
6	3/21/2025	How should West plan the play?	Oops, no Club stopper and Clubs are led. West has to take her lumps there. If Clubs split 4-3, there is still a chance to run the rest. She will need 6 Diamonds, the 2 Aces and 1 of the finesses.	20250321_1.png
7	3/21/2025	South takes the ♣Q, and returns Clubs. North gleefully collects 3 more Clubs. North exits with the ♥6 toward the weakness on the board. What does Declarer do?	It's make or break time. North had the ♣A-K, and might have had enough to bid with the major suit Kings. Flimsy but West guesses the Kings are in the South. She plays the ♥A, then works on Diamonds. She needs the ♦Q to fall doubleton, only a 25% chance.  She leads ♦2 to the Ace, and returns the ♦T. The ♦Q appears.	20250321_1.png
8	3/21/2025	Does the contract make?	Yes. West makes 6 Diamonds, ♥A, and 2 Spades with the finesse at the end. It's a lucky one, but West took the only chance she had. It paid off.	20250321_1.png

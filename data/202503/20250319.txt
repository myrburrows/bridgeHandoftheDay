1	3/19/2025	West deals How should West start the bidding?	1NT. West has 15 HCP, a stopper in each suit, and a balanced hand. She has 4 cards in both majors as well -- a plus if Partner shows interest.	20250319_1.png
2	3/19/2025	Bidding: 1NT. North will Pass. How should East respond?	2C. This is the Stayman convention. East has a 4-card major and 8+ HCP. If Opener has a 4+ major, she wants to find that and also have the strong 1NT opener become the Declarer. Stayman is so widely used that no announcement or alert is needed.	20250319_1.png
3	3/19/2025	Bidding: 1NT, P, 2C. Should West throw in a 2H bid?	No, Pass. A bid would absolutely promise a 5+-card suit.	20250319_1.png
4	3/19/2025	Bidding: 1NT, P, 2C, P. How should West bid in response to Stayman?	2H. West has both 4-card majors and should be up-the-line.	20250319_1.png
5	3/19/2025	Bidding: 1NT, P, 2C, P, 2H, P. What should responder's rebid be?	3NT. East has no interest in Hearts but 11 HCP and a balanced hand should be OK for 3NT.	20250319_1.png
6	3/19/2025	Bidding: 1NT, P, 2C, P, 2H, P. 3NT, P. Should West be satisfied to play 3NT?	No! 4S. East for sure has a 4-card major and if not Hearts ... West should prefer the trump fit over fighting all suits in NT. The 4-4 fit in Spades, headed by the A-K, is the better bargain.	20250319_1.png
7	3/19/2025	All Pass. 4S in the West. What should North pick for the opening lead?	♠3. North has no good target in the side suits. She knows E-W have 4-4 trumps, leaving South with 2. The defense has no good chance for a trump trick, so maybe at least the trump lead won't hurt anything.	20250319_1.png
8	3/19/2025	How should West plan the play? 	The hand seems balanced so West expects to clear trump in 3 rounds -- leaving 1 in each hand. West sees 2 Heart losers, and a Queen finesse in both minors. She will want the defense to break the minors (for a free finesse). After the ♠Q takes trick #3, she will lead the ♥9.	20250319_1.png
9	3/19/2025	Does the contract make?	Yes, South can take 2 Hearts. But, she then has to promote the ♥J or give a free finesse in a minor. Depending on how the minors go, Declarer makes 10 or 11 tricks.	20250319_1.png

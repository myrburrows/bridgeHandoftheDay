1	3/8/2025	South deals and will Pass. How should West act?	1S. Six Spades with the 5 top. This is a self-supporting suit. It expects to get 6 tricks with no help from Partner.  Shortage points are added without waiting for a fit.  It counts to 12 points and only 7 LTC. The hand is too good for a 2S preempt.  	20250308_1.png
2	3/8/2025	Bidding: P, 1S. North will Pass. How should East respond?	2C. Partner opened and we have openers +.  East has to bid game directly or bid something forcing.  3NT is reasonable, but it's not recommended to cut off a major suit. 2C forces West. If West supports Clubs, East can bid 3NT.	20250308_1.png
3	3/8/2025	Bidding: P, 1S, P, 2C, P. What should be the rebid by West?	2S. That's an easy one. It shows 6 or more Spades, and a minimum opener.	20250308_1.png
4	3/8/2025	Bidding: P, 1S, P, 2C, P, 2S, P. What should be the rebid by responder?	4S. There is a fit -- at least 6 Spades plus 2.  West does not know how Diamonds or Clubs might go in NoTrump. It is safer to go with the trump fit.	20250308_1.png
5	3/8/2025	All Pass. 4S in the West. What should the opening lead be from North?	♦J. There is no easy choice.  East did not support Spades, but then jumped on her next turn. It is probable that East is balanced, so not likely that a trump lead will hurt Declarer. Clubs is out as an opening lead, and the ♥Q could be a stopper. Leading the Jack, which shows the Ten, is best.	20250308_1.png
6	3/8/2025	How should West plan the play?	The first 2 Diamonds will be lost.  Then, trump in and pull trump.  South can see a Heart loser and maybe a Club. Can South do anything to help herself, other than just try the Club finesse? Yes, try Hearts first.	20250308_1.png
7	3/8/2025	After trump, South leads the A and K of Hearts. She follows with a low Heart.	If Hearts split 3-3, the fourth Heart in Dummy will be good.  West can pitch one Club there.  Even though the Club finesse is actually on-side, Declarer gave herself 2 bites at the apple by trying Hearts first.	20250308_1.png
8	3/8/2025	Does the game bid make?	Yes. It is only losing 2 Diamonds and 1 Heart.	20250308_1.png

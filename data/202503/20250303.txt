1	3/3/2025	South and West will Pass. Should North open?	Yes, 1D. There are a lot of contrary factors here. North does not have opening HCP, LTC, or Bergen 20. NS are vulnerable.  On the other hand, "third hand, bid if you can". The Diamonds are biddable, and South may say 1 Spade back.  The metrics are close, Partner knows this is third chair. We didn't just come here to hold up the cards!	20250303_1.png
2	3/3/2025	Bidding: 1D. What overcall should East make?	1H. One could bid Double here with any shape, as the hand is easily more than 17 HCP.  This would force partner to bid.  In this case, however, East really doesn't want to hear Partner say 1S, 1NT, or 2C. East bids the under-valued 1H overcall, hoping to show strength later.	20250303_1.png
3	3/3/2025	Bidding: 1D, 1H.  South must Pass. What advance should West make to East's overcall?	2H. Even though Partner's overcall could be quite weak, West is obligated to raise with trump support and 6 or more points.	20250303_1.png
4	3/3/2025	Bidding: 1D, 1H, P, 2H. North must Pass. What should West's rebid be?	4H. The combined hands must have 25+ points and 8+ Hearts.  	20250303_1.png
5	3/3/2025	All Pass. 4H in the East.  What should South lead first?	3♦. Leading Partner's bid suit is the top priority, without very strong reasons for doing otherwise.  We play high from a doubleton and low from 3 or more.	20250303_1.png
6	3/3/2025	North will take the Ace of Diamonds and switch to the Jack of Spades.  Why break Spades?	North looks at the weakness on the board in Spades.  The defense is not going to have much of a chance anyway, if East has both the Ace and Queen of Spades. Better to get any tricks possible before that dangerous Club suit gets played. 	20250303_1.png
7	3/3/2025	The defense gets the first 3 tricks before East gets in (trumping Spades or taking a Diamond).  What should Declarer do now?	The is no fancy stuff now. Play the A-K of Hearts, and the suit splits 3-2.  Cross to the ♥Q, and try the Queen of Clubs.  When the King shows up in North's hand, East waltzes home with 10 tricks.	20250303_1.png

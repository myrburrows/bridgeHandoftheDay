1	3/11/2025	South deals.  How should South open the bidding?	Pass. There are only 10 HCP and it's short of the "Bergen 20".	20250311_1.png
2	3/11/2025	Bidding: P. West should Pass. What should North open?	1S. There are 12 HCP and a good 5-card Spade suit (the "Master Suit"). In the third chair, North wants to open if she can, and this hand is good enough.	20250311_1.png
3	3/11/2025	Bidding: P, P, 1S. East cannot overcall, so passes. How should South respond?	? It is a good question and depends on Partnership agreements.  Playing SAYC and "Jacoby 2NT", 2NT here says "4+ Spades and game-going values". Despite the initial Pass, South has re-evaluated (3 points for the singleton) and forces. That has to be the shared understanding.	20250311_1.png
4	3/11/2025	Bidding: P, P, 1S, P, 2NT, P. What should North's rebid be?	4S. Following "Jacoby 2NT" convention, 4S here is a cutoff. It shows a minimum opener with no interest in slam.	20250311_1.png
5	3/11/2025	All Pass. 4S in the North. What should East do for the opening lead?	♠Q. There is no good, attacking lead in a side suit. South only had opening values after Spades were bid, showing shortage somewhere. East will  try to cut ruffing cards, even though declarer has at least 9 Spades total.   The trump lead can't hurt West.	20250311_1.png
6	3/11/2025	How should North plan the play?	That ♠Q lead will make North think hard. There is a Heart loser and no Diamond losers.  The double finesse in Clubs has a 75% chance of only losing 1. Now trump, was that opening lead a singleton?	20250311_1.png
7	3/11/2025	North will overtake the ♠Q with the ♠K.  Now what?	Lead the ♦A and then trump the ♦7 in Dummy. Lead a small trump to the Ace. If West started with Jxx (and we lose a trump trick), so be it.  Declarer has to trump the last Diamond loser, first priority. As it is, the ♠J falls from East on the big trump.	20250311_1.png
8	3/11/2025	Does the contract make?	Yes, declarer only loses the Heart and 1 Club with the ♣K and ♣J split. North will lead the ♣5 from hand, East will play low, and the ♣T will be played from Dummy. The King falls and the finesse for the Jack is exposed. It makes an overtrick.	20250311_1.png

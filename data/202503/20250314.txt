1	3/14/2025	North deals. What should North open?	1D. There is opening count, but not enough for 1NT and not enough Hearts for 1H.	20250314_1.png
2	3/14/2025	Bidding: 1D. What should East overcall?	1S. East has 5 strong Spades and opening count. Easy one.	20250314_1.png
3	3/14/2025	Bidding: 1D, 1S. Should South respond and, if so, what?	Double! It's the Negative Double. This is a bid for Responder when there is an overcall. For the bid, 3 No's and 2 Yes's are needed. 1) can I support Partner?, 2) can I bid NT with a stopper in overcall suit?, and 3) can I bid my own suit? It is No, No, No. Do I have 6 or more HCP (overcall is at the 1-level)?, do I have 4 cards in the unbid major?. Yes, Yes! This situation occurs more often than you would think,	20250314_1.png
4	3/14/2025	Bidding: 1D, 1S, X. West will Pass. What is North's rebid?	2H. Partner's negative double is a type of Takeout Double, therefore forcing. It is not uncondtionally forcing, if North wants to defend 1S. She does not. There is a fit in Hearts so support at lowest level available.	20250314_1.png
5	3/14/2025	Bidding: 1D, 1S, X, P, 2H. Should East bid again?	No, Pass. It wouldn't be criminal to try 2S, but West could be a complete blank (with both opponents bidding). East should have 6 Spades to go.	20250314_1.png
6	3/14/2025	All Pass. 2H in the North. What should East lead?	♠K. The top of the honor sequence is an easy pick.	20250314_1.png
7	3/14/2025	How should North plan the play?	The clear losers are 2 Spades, the Ace of trump, and ♣A. Should North pull trump? The contract is in big trouble anyway if trump does not split 3-2. Go with the odds and pull trump, hoping to lose only 1 Heart. Maybe defenders will have to lead a minor suit into declarer's gap-y honors.	20250314_1.png
8	3/14/2025	Should North cover the ♠K?	Yes, there is no reason to hold-up and West could be singleton. Lead the 3♥. West will cover the ♥T with the Ace, and return Spades. East can take 2 rounds of Spades. She should never lead either minor, and shoud exit with the ♥7.	20250314_1.png
9	3/14/2025	How should North proceed now?	North will draw trump in 2 rounds, then lead the ♦Q. East should duck, looking at the ♦J and ♦T in Dummy. The next Diamond has to be taken in  Dummy and a low Club led. West will play low and now it is a guess for North. With no reason to expect West to have the ♣A, play the ♣T. The Ace covers, so only one Club loser.	20250314_1.png
10	3/14/2025	Does the contract make?	Yes, it is plus 1 with 9 tricks. Declarer only loses 1 Heart, 2 Spades, and a Club.	20250314_1.png

1	3/25/2025	South deals. What should South open?	2C. This hand has the look of NT, but is between 2NT and 3NT for HCP. South expects to bid 2NT on her rebid to complete the description of her hand. South opens the 2C artificial strong hand.	20250325_1.png
2	3/25/2025	Bidding: 2C. West will Pass. How should North respond?	2H. N-S play the artificial "step system" in response to 2C (2D=0-3 HCP, 2H=4-6 HCP, ...). South must Alert 2H, to let E-W find out the meaning. The more common response is artificial 2D "waiting".	20250325_1.png
3	3/25/2025	Bidding: 2C, P, 2H. East will Pass. How should South rebid?	2NT. This bid shows the hand exactly: balanced and 22 or 23 HCP.	20250325_1.png
4	3/25/2025	Bidding: 2C, P, 2H, P, 2NT, P. How should North rebid?	3NT. This is game-going count in NT -- North's 5 with opener's 22/23.	20250325_1.png
5	3/25/2025	3NT in the South. All Pass. What is the opening from West?	♥K. This is the top of a 4-card honor sequence. No other lead is even in the running.	20250325_1.png
6	3/25/2025	After seeing the opening lead and North's hand, how should South plan the play?	Clear winners are 4 Clubs, 2 Diamonds and a Heart. South can win 2 Spades by driving out the Ace, but the defense will win that and continue Hearts if they can. Declarer has 5 Hearts and defenders have 8. If Hearts started 4-4 -- no problem. If Hearts split 5-3 (much more probable), South could lose 4 Hearts and a Spade.	20250325_1.png
7	3/25/2025	How should South play on the opening lead?	Duck and don't play the Ace until she has to (the third round). If Hearts started 5-3, South has to hope that the defender with the Ace of Spades started with only 3 Hearts.  The delay in playing the ♥A is the "hold up" play.	20250325_1.png
8	3/25/2025	Does declarer make 3NT by taking 9 tricks?	Yes. Defenders only get the first 2 Hearts, then the ♠A and a Spade at the end. By wisely holding up on the ♥A, East was out of Hearts after collecting the ♠A.	20250325_1.png

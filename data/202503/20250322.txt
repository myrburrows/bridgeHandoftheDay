1	3/22/2025	West deals and will Pass. How should North open the bidding?	1D. North has opening count and a good 5-card suits. The Spades aren't good enough.	20250322_1.png
2	3/22/2025	Bidding: P, 1D. East will Pass. How should South respond?	1S. South will make an unlimited forcing bid with the 4-card Spades. This is a very strong hand opposite 1D opener. 3NT is a temptation but the Hearts aren't there. For 2-over-1 players, South should bid 2C -- artificial and game-forcing. That would serve well on this hand.	20250322_1.png
3	3/22/2025	Bidding: P, 1D, P, 1S, P. How should North rebid?	2S. Even with the doubletons added value, North still has a minimum opener. If Spades or HCP were a tick better, she could bid 3S to invite game.	20250322_1.png
4	3/22/2025	Bidding: P, 1D, P, 1S, P, 2S, P. How should South rebid?	4S. North has showed a minimum count with 4 Spades. With the flat distribution, South cannot push it. 17 points plus a max of 15 just does not add up to slam.	20250322_1.png
5	3/22/2025	Bidding: P, 1D, P, 1S, P, 2S, P, 4S. All Pass. 4S in the South. What should be the opening lead for West?	♦6. It is usually a bad idea to lead a singleton small trump. Partner may have a stack. West is not under-leading a King. That leaves Diamonds. We play Middle-Up-Down from nothing.	20250322_1.png
6	3/22/2025	After seeing the opening lead and Dummy, how should Declarer plan the play?	South will plan to pull trump, take 5 Diamonds and 2 Aces. That's 11 tricks already and she just as well plan to take the Heart finesse. If trump are 3-2, they will fall. South just as well protect against 4 Spades in the East. It costs nothing.	20250322_1.png
7	3/22/2025	South will play the ♦J, and then what?	South leads the ♠A, then small over to the ♠Q. West shows out but South has planned for that. It will take all the trump, but she can finnesse out the ♠J-9 with the ♠KT. South didn't have any side-suit to trump anyway.	20250322_1.png
8	3/22/2025	After collecting 4 trump tricks, South can try the Heart finesse. How does the play go from there?	The finesse is on, so that is 2 Heart tricks. South only has to be careful not to block Diamonds in her hand. Playing ♦A then low, Declarer wins 5 Diamond tricks. She still has the ♣A too.	20250322_1.png
9	3/22/2025	Does the contract make?	Yes, 12 tricks. It is sad to miss slam, but sticking to the bidding agreements pays off. When you bid by the book, you always build trust with Partner. There is even one more trick possible in 4S. Do you see it?	20250322_1.png

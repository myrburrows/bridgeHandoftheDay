1	3/13/2025	West deals. What should West open?	1H. West has a good 5-card major, 13 HCP, low LTC, and high "Bergen 20".  No worries.	20250313_1.png
2	3/13/2025	Bidding: 1H. North will Pass. Can East say anything but Pass?	No, Pass. East has trump support, and that singleton. Still, it can count to only 4.  The hand is at least a Queen short of any bid.	20250313_1.png
3	3/13/2025	Bidding: 1H, P, P. What does South say?	2D. It's the balancing hand, but no extra incentive to bid is needed.  Double is reasonable. With17 HCP, she can double with any distribution and make partner bid. 3D is good if you play a jump overcall as strong, but we play it as weak.  Not wanting to hear 1S or 1NT back from the takeout double, South chooses conservative 2D	20250313_1.png
4	3/13/2025	Bidding: 1H, P, P, 2D. Does West have a rebid?	No, Pass. It is a minimum count with no rebiddable suit and no second suit. West should be good for defense with the power behind the overcaller.	20250313_1.png
5	3/13/2025	Bidding: 1H, P, P, 2D, P. Should North advance the bidding?	Yes, 3D. Partner has promised 10+ HCP, and 6 (or 5 strong) Diamonds.The HCP count is light, but 4 Diamonds with 2 honors is enough.	20250313_1.png
6	3/13/2025	Bidding: 1H, P, P, 2D, P, 3D. East will Pass. Should South bid again?	Yes, 3NT. For her bid, South expects Partner to have the ♦K. She hopes for 6 Diamond tricks plus the 2 Aces. Partner does not have to add much for South to find the ninth trick.	20250313_1.png
7	3/13/2025	All Pass. 3NT in the South. What is the opening lead for West?	♥8. Against NoTrump, the standard is to not lead the top of a 2-card honor sequence. The usual practice is to lead fourth down.	20250313_1.png
8	3/13/2025	What is South's plan of play? Will the bid make?	Yes, on the 8♥ lead, declarer gets 2 Hearts, 6 Diamonds and a Spade. But ...	20250313_1.png
9	3/13/2025	A wily West, knowing South has the ♥A and not trusting East to have the J♥, leads the ♥K! What does Declarer plan now?	"Oops. There goes my second Heart stopper". Declarer ducks 2 rounds of Hearts, and then will play the Ace. Then will follow 6 rounds of Diamonds. Everybody will have 4 cards left. Declarer has ♠A5 and ♣K4.	20250313_1.png
10	3/13/2025	Can you see the squeeze coming on West? Her last 5 cards are ♣A, ♥98, ♠K7. There is nothing safe to discard on the last Diamond.	South knows that West has all the money. On the last Diamond, West will most likely pitch the ♠7. No matter, South knows what West must have. The ♠K is now unguarded, and the Ace drops it and the Q♠ is trick #9. If West pitches a good Heart, South will put West on lead with a Club, and there are 2 black tricks to make it.	20250313_1.png

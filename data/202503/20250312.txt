1	3/12/2025	South deals.  How should South open the bidding?	1S. This is a strong hand with very good Spades. It has a high "Bergen 20" and very low LTC.	20250312_1.png
2	3/12/2025	Bidding: 1S. West will Pass, but starts planning the defense against Spades. How should North respond?	1NT. The hand is a little above the SAYC range (6-9 HCP), but there's no good option. There is no 5-card suit to raise to the 2-level. North does not have an Ace, and that singleton is in Partner's opened suit.  1NT is plenty.	20250312_1.png
3	3/12/2025	Bidding: 1S, P, 1NT. East will Pass. What is the best rebid for South?	2H.Responder has less than 3 Spades, so maybe there's room for Hearts. 2H shows at least 5-5 in the majors. Even if South is very weak and all minors, she should at least give a preference by passing 2H or going back to 2S. A new suit by the opener, with no jump, is not forcing.	20250312_1.png
4	3/12/2025	Bidding: 1S, P, 1NT, P, 2H, P. What should North's rebid be?	4H. North can re-evaluate the singleton to 3 points. There is a likely 9-card fit in Hearts. If North bids 3H, it would show interest in game, but South could easily say Pass. This hand is too good for that.	20250312_1.png
5	3/12/2025	All Pass. 4H in the South. What is the opening lead from West?	♣J. It's the top of an honor sequence, although it's nothing great.  There is no better option.	20250312_1.png
6	3/12/2025	How does South plan the play as declarer?	If East has the ♣A, it looks like 2 Club losers off the top, and the Ace of trump to come. If all the missing trump are in 1 hand, there will likely be a second Heart loser. Barring the 4-0 split, the contract will make.	20250312_1.png
7	3/12/2025	As an extra check, before playing on the opening lead, should South count winners?	Yes, as Declarer, always take a check of winners. South has no Clubs, 2 Diamonds, and 3 Spades.  South expects of clear trump in 3 rounds, losing one.  That is 8 tricks. South will get extras by trumping Diamonds in hand, and Spades in Dummy.  There are enough winners.	20250312_1.png
8	3/12/2025	Does South make her bid?	Yes, South will take the third trick, and lead a low trump toward the K-Q. The Ace falls, and the contract is safe.	20250312_1.png

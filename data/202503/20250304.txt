1	3/4/2025	South will Pass.  How should West open the bidding?	1C.  This is a solid opening hand, just short of 1NT.  West does not have a 5-card major to open, but will be happy to hear Hearts or Spades from East.  EW are playing "standard" minors, so 1C promises 3+ of them.	20250304_1.png
2	3/4/2025	Bidding: P, 1C.  North will Pass with no 5+-card suit.  How should West respond?	1S. The range for 1-over-1 is unlimited.  West is forced to bid again. East can show the extra strength on her rebid.	20250304_1.png
3	3/4/2025	Bidding: P, 1C, P, 1S, P. What should West rebid?	3S. West should encourage game with 16 points and A-K-x-x of Spades.	20250304_1.png
4	3/4/2025	Bidding: P, 1C, P, 1S, P, 3S, P.  Should East try for slam by bidding 4NT Blackwood?	No, not quite.  Even if West has a dream hand (like A-K of Spades, plus both red Aces), the minors have likely losers.  If West has more than that, she should have bid something forcing herself.	20250304_1.png
5	3/4/2025	Bidding: P, 1C, P, 1S, P, 3S, P. What should East say on her rebid?	4S. 	20250304_1.png
6	3/4/2025	All Pass. 4S in the East.  What should be the opening lead from South?	♥3. There is nothing at all to recommend anything. Pick a random card? Since East bid Spades over 1C, maybe Hearts are weak.	20250304_1.png
7	3/4/2025	North will take the Ace and return Hearts. What is the line of play for East?	Declarer will take the second Heart and pull trump in 2 rounds, ending in Dummy. Lead the ♦2, and maybe a foolish defender will hold-up on the King.  If there is no blunder, the contract makes 11 tricks.	20250304_1.png
8	3/4/2025	Is this a flat board with no gain on the field for EW?	Some pairs will likely not do as well at 3NT (10 tricks only) or even 6S.  Regardless, EW bid and played to their standards.  The results are the results.	20250304_1.png

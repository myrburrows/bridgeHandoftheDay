1	3/6/2025	The dealer is East.  Should East open?	1S. 13 HCP, only 6 LTC, and a biddable Spade suit.	20250306_1.png
2	3/6/2025	Bidding: 1S. Should South overcall?	2H. South has plenty of money for a 2-over-1 overcall. Partner will expect a 6-card suit, and may support with only 2. Nevertheless, A-Q-J-x-x is strong enough to push.	20250306_1.png
3	3/6/2025	Bidding: 1S, 2H. West will Pass.  Should North advance?	Yes, 4H.  This is aggressive, but justified. "4 trump + 6 trump = 10 tricks" by the Law of Total Tricks. North does not like the Kings positioned in front of the opener. But, there's some strength in the doubletons, and the 5 Clubs could play.	20250306_1.png
4	3/6/2025	All Pass. The contract is 4H in the South. What should West lead to start?	7♠. Choosing which Spade depends on your methods. One standard is to lead low from 3 or more, and high from doubleton.	20250306_1.png
5	3/6/2025	How should South plan the play?	Plan A is to take the first trick in dummy and finesse trumps. If East has the King, it's straightforward to pull trump then finesse in Clubs.  East can't hurt the bid in Diamonds, if the Club finesse loses.  	20250306_1.png
6	3/6/2025	Should declarer make a Plan B?	Yes. N/S have combined 24 HCP. East opened, so maybe 13 HCP there. That leaves just room for West to have 1 big card, and the bid is sunk on Plan A if it is the ♥K.  She will return Diamonds and 2 of those will be lost, along the 1 trump and the ♣K.  Down 1.	20250306_1.png
7	3/6/2025	What can South do to try to make the contract, even if the King of Hearts is in the West hand?	The whole thing rests on keeping West off lead. South should take the first Spade in-hand, and lead a small Heart. South does not mind losing the Heart trick to East. Maybe West will not put up the ♥K if she has it.	20250306_1.png
8	3/6/2025	What happens after South leads the ♥6 at trick #2?	West will likely play low, as the King is still guarded.  South will win in Dummy, and return trump to the Ace.  The Club finesse is next, losing to the King.  East cannot beat the contract.  Declarer can throw 2 Diamond losers on Dummy's Clubs.  	20250306_1.png
9	3/6/2025	Does the contract make?	Likely Yes, on Plan B.  The defense gets a Club, and eventually the King of Hearts. By that point, South only has 1 Diamond loser -- making four.	20250306_1.png

1	3/28/2025	North deals. What should North open?	1NT. North has a standard-looking 1NT opener.  It's balanced, has stoppers, and has the right count.	20250328_1.png
2	3/28/2025	Bidding: 1NT. East will Pass. How should South respond with the monster Club suit?	A good question. South thinks that slam is likely out of reach, not expecting North to win 4 of 5 losers. But there is surely game somewhere -- Clubs, Spades or NT. A blast to 5C or 3NT (North may not have the ♣A these days) could go wrong. South will start by finding out if there is a Spade fit, using Stayman. 2C.	20250328_1.png
3	3/28/2025	Bidding: 1NT, P, 2C. Should West get in on the action?	Yes, 2H. Why let N-S have all the fun? With 10 HCP, 6 Hearts and a singleton, it is unlikely West will get into a disaster of a contract. There are 2 principles in favor of bidding: Hearts should be a good opening lead for Partner and it's good to interfere with NT when reasonable.	20250328_1.png
4	3/28/2025	Bidding: 1NT, P, 2C, 2H. What should North rebid?	2S. This is responding to Partner's Stayman bid. It shows 4 Spades and nothing extra.	20250328_1.png
5	3/28/2025	Bidding: 1NT, P, 2C, 2H, 2S. Should East throw in a bid?	Yes, 4H. East expects E-W to hold 11 Hearts. Even with such weak HCP, a Not Vulnerable sacrifice here should be worthwhile.	20250328_1.png
6	3/28/2025	Bidding: 1NT, P, 2C, 2H, 2S, 4H. What should South rebid?	4S. Even knowing that North has at least 2 Clubs, South will go with the fit in Spades. Making 5C would be a poor score if 4S can be brought home.	20250328_1.png
7	3/28/2025	All Pass. 4S in the North. What should East lead?	♥4.  Pick the most sensible Heart, 4th down in this case.	20250328_1.png
8	3/28/2025	After seeing the opening lead and the Dummy hand, how should North plan the play?	North has to worry that somebody has 4 Spades. Also, with only 2 Clubs missing, the defense could steal a trick if one of them is void. North has to pull trump as soon as possible.	20250328_1.png
9	3/28/2025	North will trump trick #1 in Dummy and try the ♠Q finesse. It fails. East is in with the ♠K and leads a Diamond. Then what?	West takes the ♦A and leads the ♥A. North trumps in Dummy and leads the ♠J. Both opponents follow, so trump split 3-2. That's the first hurdle. The dummy is out of trump so North has to try a small Club to the ♣A. Both opponents have a Club! The ♠A collects the last trump, and Declarer gets to run out the Clubs.	20250328_1.png
10	3/28/2025	Does the contract make?	Yes. It's making 11 tricks by losing only the ♠K and the ♦A.	20250328_1.png

1	3/24/2025	South deals. What should South open?	1NT. This hand has all the criteria -- count and balanced (although 4-3-3-3 is not a good thing).	20250324_1.png
2	3/24/2025	Bidding: 1NT. Should West overcall?	Yes, 2C. In SAYC, West should show a good hand with strong Clubs. It's a good idea to interfere with NT when you can and take away Stayman in this case. Also, West wants to invite a Club lead if North ends up declaring somewhere.	20250324_1.png
3	3/24/2025	Bidding: 1NT, 2C. How should North respond?	Double. This artificial bid is played by many SAYC pairs. When Partner opens 1NT or 2NT, and not-nice RHO overcalls something, the artificial double means "I was about to bid what this opponent just overcalled with". In this case, North has a 4-card major and 8 HCP -- Stayman.	20250324_1.png
4	3/24/2025	Bidding: 1NT, 2C, X. East will Pass. What should South do on the rebid?	2S. South is bidding in response to Stayman. She has 4 Spades.	20250324_1.png
5	3/24/2025	Bidding: 1NT, 2C, X, P, 2S. West will Pass now. What should North say?	2NT. This bid shows 8-9 HCP and denies Spades. A bid of 3D would show 6 of them.	20250324_1.png
6	3/24/2025	Bidding: 1NT, 2C, X, P, 2S, P, 2NT, P. Should South Pass or press to 3NT?	3NT. It is not great but South is at least borderline for NT game. She has extra info the Clubs and strength are in the West. South hope that will be enough knowledge to find a 9th trick somewhere.	20250324_1.png
7	3/24/2025	All Pass. 3NT in the South. What should West pick for the opening lead?	♣4. West could lead A-K, then small. Yes, Club #4 and #5 will likely become good, but also Partner will likely be out of Clubs too. She won't be able to lead Clubs if she gets in. Lead small from a 2-card honor sequence against NT.	20250324_1.png
8	3/24/2025	After seeing the opening lead and dummy, how should South plan the play?	South can see a Club trick,2 Hearts and a Spade, and will need 5 Diamonds to make it. From the bidding, South can place the ♠K in West. With long Clubs in West, it's a good guess that Diamonds are in the East. If East has the ♦Q and 3 Diamonds, the regular finesse will lose and down South goes. South goes for the "backward" finesse.	20250324_1.png
9	3/24/2025	South takes the opening Club, and crosses to the ♥K. What is next?	♦J! This is truly "backward", named so because it often backfires. Declarer would only use it when the bidding or early play has given info on specific card placement. With the long odds that the ♦Q cannot be finessed traditionally, South hooks it with the high Diamond from Dummy.	20250324_1.png
10	3/24/2025	Does the 3NT contract make?	Yes, by use of opponent's bidding, South correct figured the placement of the key Queen. This looks bad if the ♦Q shows up in the West but you "pay your money and you take your chances".	20250324_1.png

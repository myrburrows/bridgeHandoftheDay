1	3/27/2025	South deals. What should South open?	1C. South has the count to open, and there is no other choice. Playing "standard" minors, this bid just promises 3+ Clubs. South expects to show real Clubs on the next bid.	20250327_1.png
2	3/27/2025	Bidding: 1C. Should West overcall 1H or 2H?	2H. West bids the preempt to show the Heart length. The West HCP count is in the right range (8+ at the 2-level). She also wants to cut off the too-easy 1S response.	20250327_1.png
3	3/27/2025	Bidding: 1C, 2H. What should North bid?	Double. This is the "negative" double, and is a type of takeout double. North shows 8+ HCP and the unbid suits. It will be forcing if East passes.	20250327_1.png
4	3/27/2025	Bidding: 1C, 2H, X. What should East bid?	3H. East should invite game. She adds points for the singleton, and wants West to bid game with anything more than the minimum. East is just short of bidding 4H herself, and some players would bid it.	20250327_1.png
5	3/27/2025	Bidding: 1C, 2H, X, 3H. Should South bid again?	No, Pass. With both opponents bidding, it seems likely that Partner is in the 8-10 HCP range with 4 Spades and 4 or 5 Diamonds (for the negative double). That's probably not going to play very well, offense or defense. 	20250327_1.png
6	3/27/2025	Bidding: 1C, 2H, X, 3H, P. Should West go to game?	Yes, 4H. West can add points for the short black suits with the Heart fit, and is well-over a minimum hand.	20250327_1.png
7	3/27/2025	All Pass. 4H in the West. What should North's opening lead be?	♣5. Maybe South will have AKx. North can signal her doubleton with the ♣3, and maybe trump the third round with the ♥3.	20250327_1.png
8	3/27/2025	After seeing the opening lead and Dummy's hand, how should South plan the play?	South sees only 3 losers: ♥A, ♣A, and maybe a Spade, if trump split 2-1. South can trump 2 Diamonds in Dummy, and develop a Spade trick to pitch the last Diamond.	20250327_1.png
9	3/27/2025	West plays the ♣J from Dummy on the first trick, and South takes it with the ♣K (to show the ♣A). What should South lead at trick #2?	♥J. South saw 10 Clubs at the start, so either Declarer or Partner is out. If West had the singleton, she will trump the ♣A, and the ♣Q will be promoted in Dummy. That is too much risk. South sees the short Diamond on the board, so she will lead trump to reduce ruffing. North will play the ♥A and lead another trump.	20250327_1.png
10	3/27/2025	Does the contract make?	Yes. Declarer will lead a Spade, losing to the ♠K. South can then trump 2 Diamonds and discard the third on the third round of Spades. West takes 5 Hearts in hand, 2 more by ruffing, 2 Spades and a Diamond.	20250327_1.png

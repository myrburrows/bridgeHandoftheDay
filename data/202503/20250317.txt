1	3/17/2025	North deals. Should North open?	No. North has 10 HCP, and should not add "shortage" points for the singleton until a trump fit is found.	20250317_1.png
2	3/17/2025	Bidding: P. What should East open?	1S. The Spades suit is self-supporting. East has a medium-range opener with some credit added for the singleton Heart.	20250317_1.png
3	3/17/2025	Bidding: P, 1S. What should South overcall?	Double. South is never going to Pass here. 2H is an option but those Hearts aren't great. The Takeout Double promises 1) openers, 2) Spade shortage, and 3) at least 3 cards in the unbid suits. Check, check and check.	20250317_1.png
4	3/17/2025	Bidding: P, 1S, X. West will Pass. How should North answer Partner's Takeout Double?	3H. South has at least 3 Hearts, so there is a fit. North adds shortage points for the singleton. A jump bid shows 10 or more points, and 4+ Hearts. A 4H bid is tempting, but South could have only 3 small Hearts. Also, her double might be a bit light in third chair and not vulnerable.	20250317_1.png
5	3/17/2025	Bidding: P, 1S, X, P, 3H. Should East say 3S?	No, Pass. East has 6 tricks on her own, but will likely have no help from West. The hand looks weak on defense, so why push N-S to go to game?	20250317_1.png
6	3/17/2025	Bidding: P, 1S, X, P, 3H, P. What should South's rebid be?	4H. It's an easy decision. North will have 9+ trump, and she will surely fill in some of the missing honors. The value of the singleton is up, too.	20250317_1.png
7	3/17/2025	Bidding: P, 1S, X, P, 3H, P, 4H. All Pass. 4H in the North. What will East lead to start?	♠A. Better to collect any Spade tricks before they evaporate.	20250317_1.png
8	3/17/2025	After the opening lead, how does Declarer plan the play?	It looks like a walk in the park, even if trumps split 3-0. North will be in on the second lead, and then pull trump. There is no side suit to develop. She will just pitch a Diamond on Dummy's ♣K.	20250317_1.png
9	3/17/2025	Does the contract make?	Yes. North takes 11 tricks, losing only a Spade and a Diamond.	20250317_1.png

1	3/15/2025	South deals. What should South open?	1S. There are 6 good Spades and 13 HCP. LTC and "Bergen 20" look good for opening.	20250315_1.png
2	3/15/2025	Bidding: 1S. West will Pass. How should North respond?	2C. North has Spade support but, with game-going count, no Spade bid is right. 2S, 3S, 4S, and 2NT are all "off". The Clubs are enough for a forcing 2C, and North expects for choose a game based on South's rebid.	20250315_1.png
3	3/15/2025	Bidding: 1S, P, 2C. East will Pass. What will South rebid?	2S. This is a minimum opener with rebiddable Spades. Easy one.	20250315_1.png
4	3/15/2025	Bidding: 1S, P, 2C, P, 2S, P. What should Responder's rebid be?	4S. South showed 6 Spades so North's 3, with 2 top honors, make a strong fit. The combined count is enough for a game try.	20250315_1.png
5	3/15/2025	Bidding: 1S, P, 2C, P, 2S, P, 4S. All Pass. 4S in the South. What should the opening lead from West be?	♥K. The top of a 2-card honor sequence is normal against a suit contract. With no info from East in the bidding, this is the best available.	20250315_1.png
6	3/15/2025	How should South plan the play?	Counting losers, there are a Heart and a Diamond. Clubs will lose 1 if the ♣A is in the West, and 2 if in the East. South can play fast and dirty by pulling trump then trying the indirect finesse in Clubs, low from hand toward the ♣K. It's 50-50 make or break. Could chances be improved?	20250315_1.png
7	3/15/2025	Declarer can see 7 Clubs and entries to Dummy. Could Clubs be developed to sluff a red loser?	South can find a way. The odds are high that trump will break 3-1 and Clubs 4-2. The last Club in Dummy will be good if developed. South can use Spades to cross to Dummy, but must delay pulling trump. She starts by leading ♣2 after taking the ♥A. The ♣K loses to the ♣A. OK, it's Plan B.	20250315_1.png
8	3/15/2025	East is on lead, probably returning a Heart.  What happens next with West on lead?	Whatever West leads next, South is in control. She will lead her last Club, and East will take. If Clubs are returned, South will trump high so West can't over-trump. She will cross to the ♦K, lead Dummy's Club, and trump high. That is East's last Club, gone.  Now, pull trump and ending in Dummy for the good Club and discard.	20250315_1.png
9	3/15/2025	Does the contract make?	Yes, losing just 2 Clubs and a Heart. Declarer earned herself a tenth trick, even after the ♣A was "wrong".	20250315_1.png

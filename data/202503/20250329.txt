1	3/29/2025	South deals. What should South open?	1C. This is about as weak of an opening hand as you will find, but the count is there. N-S are bidding "standard" minors, so 1C has no artificial meaning. South has no other biddable suit.	20250329_1.png
2	3/29/2025	Bidding: 1C. What should West do?	Double. West has the count and distribution for a Takeout Double. Not that West has a way to know this at the start, but the opponents may take advantage of bids to figure out how to play the hand.	20250329_1.png
3	3/29/2025	Bidding: 1C, X. How should North respond?	1H. North could redouble to show her count, but bids up-the-line to get the majors into the bidding.	20250329_1.png
4	3/29/2025	Bidding: 1C, X, 1H. North's bid has removed the force on East, and she will Pass. What should South do on the rebid?	1NT. North's response is forcing. South can't support Hearts with 3, can't bid Spades and can't rebid Clubs. 1NT shows a minimum opener with no strong suit, exactly.	20250329_1.png
5	3/29/2025	Bidding: 1C, X, 1H, P, 1NT. West will Pass. How should North rebid?	3NT. N-S are openers-across-from-openers, so there must be a shot at game. North thinks that the Hearts are just good enough for the try. If the ♥J was off lamely into a minor suit, North would just Pass.	20250329_1.png
6	3/29/2025	All Pass. 3NT in the South. What should West's opening lead be?	♦K. It's the top of a long honor sequence, and in an unbid suit. 	20250329_1.png
7	3/29/2025	After seeing the ♦K lead and the dummy hand, how would South plan the play?	South sees 8 tricks with big cards: 2 Spades, 4 Hearts, and 2 minor suit Aces. What suit could produce a 9th trick? It's Spades. If they split 3-3, the last Spade in Dummy would be good. There could be another play in Spades too -- let's see. For sure, South needs 3 Spade tricks to make.	20250329_1.png
8	3/29/2025	South will duck 2 rounds of Diamonds, the take the Ace. She will cross to Dummy in Hearts, and lead the ♠4. Why?	South must lose a Spade trick anyway, and she can watch the spots carefully. She leads the ♠4, East plays the ♠8, South the ♠9, and West the ♠J. Interesting! The missing Spades are now Q T 3 2.	20250329_1.png
9	3/29/2025	West cashes the last Diamond and, never wanting to start Clubs, exits with a Heart. That's 4 tricks for E-W.  How does South play it?	South plays 4 rounds of Hearts, then the ♠5. East plays ♠T, South the ♠K, and West the ♠2. Now only the ♠Q and ♠3 are missing. Are they split? Let's think about West's hand. West had 4 Diamonds and 3 little Hearts. For her bid (X), West surely had the ♠Q and less than 3 Clubs. South has placed both missing Spades in West, and she has West end-played. 	20250329_1.png
10	3/29/2025	Does the contract make?	Yes. South will lead her last Spade and take the extra Spade in Dummy, whatever West does. The ♠A7 is behind the ♠Q3. South had to get 3 Spade tricks. She didn't get the 3-3 split, but she used all her resources to find another way.	20250329_1.png

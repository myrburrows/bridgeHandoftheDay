1	3/10/2025	South deals.  How should South open the bidding?	1H. South has 16 HCP and the strong 5-card Heart suit. The singleton Ace in a side-suit is very powerful if a fit is found.	20250310_1.png
2	3/10/2025	Bidding: 1H. Should West overcall?	Yes, 1S. The HCP range for a 1-over-1 overcall is 8-17. The sequence of honors in Spades is stronger than its HCP shows.  The West hand is certainly worth the overcall.	20250310_1.png
3	3/10/2025	Bidding: 1H, 1S. Should North respond?	2H. Qxx is not great but it is Heart support. With a trump fit, a point is added for the Club doubleton.  With 6 points, North is obligated to raise Hearts with support and a hand in the 6-10 point range.	20250310_1.png
4	3/10/2025	Bidding: 1H, 1S, 2H. Should East support Spades?	2S. There is trump support, as West has promised 5+ Spades. East has weak distribution and might Pass with 6 or 7 points. Not vulnerable, this hand is just enough.	20250310_1.png
5	3/10/2025	Bidding: 1H, 1S, 2H, 2S. Should South bid again?	Yes, 4H. South adds 3 points for the singleton Spade. The hand is up to 19 points, and there should be a play for game even if Partner is at the minimum.	20250310_1.png
6	3/10/2025	All Pass. 4H in the South. What should West lead?	â™ Q. The top of an honor sequence is the #1 preference, especially after Partner has supported Spades.	20250310_1.png
7	3/10/2025	How should South plan the play?	In a suit contract, Declarer counts losers first. There are 0 Spades losers, no Club losers, 3 Diamond losers, and no trump losers (assume 3-2 split in planning). Great. That leaves 10 tricks.	20250310_1.png
8	3/10/2025	Is there a second step in making the plan?	Yes, count winners too. There is 1 Spade, 2 Clubs, no Diamonds, and 5 trump.  That is short. South cannot pull trump and pound out winners. There is a clear cross-ruff opportunity in the black suits.	20250310_1.png
9	3/10/2025	Does the contract make?	Yes. South takes a Spade and 2 Clubs with high cards. Being careful to watch transportation and before leading Hearts, trump 2 Clubs in Dummy and 3 Spades in hand. South will still hold the Ace and King of Hearts for trick #9 and #10.	20250310_1.png

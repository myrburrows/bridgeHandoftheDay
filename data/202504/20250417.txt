Q1	4/17/2025	North deals. What should North open?	1C. North easily has opening count. The hand looks NoTrump-ish, but there are 2 doubletons.	20250417_1.png
Q2	4/17/2025	Bidding: 1C. Should East overcall?	Yes, double. East has opening count, and no suit to bid. East has at least 3 cards in all side-suits for the takeout double. Her partner will expect her to have short clubs, but maybe East can bid NoTrump next to show club strength.	20250417_1.png
Q3	4/17/2025	Bidding: 1C, X. What should South bid?	Pass. South might squeeze out a 1H bid, if it had gone 1C, P. But South has no obligation now, as the takeout double will give North another chance.	20250417_1.png
Q4	4/17/2025	Bidding: 1C, X, P. What should West say?	1D. The double is forcing on West, and she bids up-the-line of her 4 nearly equal suits.	20250417_1.png
Q5	4/17/2025	Bidding: 1C, X, P, 1D. What should North say on her rebid?	1S. North can now get her 4-card major into the auction. North knows her partner is weak with likely less than 6 HCP and no suit. If East passes, then South can pick between leaving it in 1S or raising to 2C.	20250417_1.png
Q6	4/17/2025	Bidding: 1C, X, P, 1D, 1S. What should East bid now?	Pass. Bidding 1NT would promise a Spade stopper. East does not really have any more she can say at this point. 	20250417_1.png
Q7	4/17/2025	Bidding: 1C, X, P, 1D, 1S, P. Should South say anything?	1NT. South can see that her side has about half the points, and suits seem about balanced all 'round. North very likely has just 4 Spades, so 1S will be no bargain with just 6. North can bid again if NT just won't do.	20250417_1.png
Q8	4/17/2025	All pass. 1NT in the South. What should West select for the opening lead?	<span class="red">♦6</span>. West picks the 4th down from her diamonds with only a 2-card sequence on top.	20250417_1.png
Q9	4/17/2025	Declarer sees the opening <span class="red">♦6</span> and the dummy hand. How should she plan the play?	South will count winners in NoTrump. She has 3 Aces and a King for 4. South can work on knocking out the ♣A and ♣K, and then the Spade finesse. It looks pretty rosy, surprisingly.	20250417_1.png
Q10	4/17/2025	Does the contract make?	Yes. The defense can only get 3 diamonds and 2 clubs. The ♠K finesse is on-side, so 8 tricks are there.	20250417_1.png

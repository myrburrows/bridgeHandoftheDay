Q1	4/24/2025	West deals and passes. Why would North first consider passing?	North has only 10 HCP, well-short of opening value. The singleton ♣Q is dubious for any high card value to boot. North has only 2 quality cards in the whole hand. The vulnerable status urges caution.	20250424_1.png
Q2	4/24/2025	What does North finally open?	1S. The Bergen 20 is there, and only 7 LTC. North is persuaded by "5-5, come alive", especially when it is the majors. North opens the higher ranking of 2 equal length suits. She would pass if the hearts and spades were reversed.	20250424_1.png
Q3	4/24/2025	Bidding: P, 1S. East will pass. How should South respond to 1S?	2C. With 16 HCP opposite an opening hand, South has to make sure her side bids at least game. The 2C response is 1-round forcing in SAYC. If North rebids a minimum (2D, 2H, 2NT or 3C), South will rebid 3NT. If North rebids 2S (showing 6+), South will say 4S. Stronger rebids by North will be greeted enthusiastically.	20250424_1.png
Q4	4/24/2025	Bidding: P, 1S, P, 2C, P. What should North say on her rebid?	2H. The response from South is forcing. North can't rebid spdes, has no minor suit, and cannot say NT. The choice is easy.	20250424_1.png
Q5	4/24/2025	Bidding: P, 1S, P, 2C, P, 2H, P. What should South say on her rebid?	3NT. South knows that her partner's hand is in the minimum range.	20250424_1.png
Q6	4/24/2025	All pass. 3NT in the South. As West, what would you pick for the opening lead?	<span class="red">♦J</span>. From a broken honor sequence, the book recommends to lead the top of touching honors. For West, it would be great if East holds the <span class="red">♦A</span> or <span class="red">♦Q</span>. If not, at least West starts working toward 3 diamond tricks.	20250424_1.png
Q7	4/24/2025	South sees the opening lead and then the dummy hand. How should South plan the play?	Playing in NT, the declarer counts winners. From the lead, South has 2 diamond tricks. There are 5 club tricks, and the 2 major suit Aces. South has just 1 sure stopper everywhere except clubs. "Take the money and run".	20250424_1.png
Q8	4/24/2025	Does the contract make?	Yes, South cashes her 9 tricks from the top and concedes.	20250424_1.png

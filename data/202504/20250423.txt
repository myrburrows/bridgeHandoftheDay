Q1	4/23/2025	South deals and passes. West will pass. How should North open the bidding?	1NT. North has 17 HCP and a balanced 3-5-2-3 hand. She has stoppers in 4 suits. North could pick 1H if the suit was stronger. The hearts could play in NT, and 1NT is so descriptive of this hand. 1NT also cuts opponents off from a 1S overcall.	20250423_1.png
Q2	4/23/2025	Bidding: P, P, 1NT. Should East overcall?	Yes, 2S. The spade suit is lackluster, but E-W is not vulnerable. Often, overcalls against NT are distributional (see the DONT convention). With 6-4 in spades and diamonds (and her partner will likely suspect an unbalanced weak-ish hand), East can show the spade length.  Also, the value of the KJ combos improve behind power in the North.	20250423_1.png
Q3	4/23/2025	Bidding: P, P, 1NT, 2S. How should South respond?	Pass. South would have responded 2NT but now that bid would promise a spade stopper. South's xxx in spades is now a negative. East shows 6, plus her 3, doesn't leave much for North in spades.	20250423_1.png
Q4	4/23/2025	Bidding: P, P, 1NT, 2S, P. West will pass. Should North bid again?	Yes, 2NT. North has already limited her hand by opening 1NT, so her partner should not get carried away. North is at the very top of her range with 5 nice hearts. Not vulnerable, and with the penchant of opponents to try to get in the way of NT on any grounds, North pushes on.	20250423_1.png
Q5	4/23/2025	Bidding: P, P, 1NT, 2S, P, P, 2NT. East will now pass. Should South raise to 3NT?	No, pass. South knows her side surely has 25 HCP, as North must be at the max. South has good clubs, but the rest are puny. From East's 2S overcall, the defense will know just where to go to work. In sum, it seems that 8 tricks will be challenge enough.	20250423_1.png
Q6	4/23/2025	All Pass. 2NT in the North. What should East lead?	♠6. West will lead 4th down and hope that her partner has one of the big ones.	20250423_1.png
Q7	4/23/2025	North sees the opening spade lead, and the dummy hand. How should North plan the play?	The declarer counts winners in NT. South has 4 clubs and 3 side Aces from the top. The bid is 8 tricks, so where is #8? Diamonds are hopeless and East is no doubt ready to run spades after the ♠A is knocked out. It looks like the finesse of the <span class="red">♥K</span> will have to work.	20250423_1.png
Q8	4/23/2025	West plays the ♠Q on the first trick? Should North take it with the ♠A?	No, duck. North will hold up the ♠A. She wants West to be out of spades if West is in the lead later. She knows the ♠Q is likely a singleton as she sees 3 in-hand, 3 in the dummy, plus likely 6 from East. Still, she has to block the spades while she can.	20250423_1.png
Q9	4/23/2025	West switches to the ♣2. What is North to think about that?	First, West is out of spades. Next, West did not switch to hearts, probably did not want to lead toward the <span class="red">♥Q</span>. West chose a club for a safe exit.	20250423_2.png
Q10	4/23/2025	Does the contract make?	Yes. North will collect 4 clubs and then try the <span class="red">♥Q</span>. West can cover, but the <span class="red">♥J</span> is promoted. West takes 4 clubs, 2 hearts and 2 aces for her 8 tricks.	20250423_2.png

Q1	4/26/2025	East deals. What should East open?	East has all the elements for a 1NT open: 15 HCP, balanced hand, and 3 suits stopped. She is not put off by the worthless xxx in hearts. West will understand that East is not promising stoppers in 4 suits.	20250426_1.png
Q2	4/26/2025	South will pass. How should West respond to 1NT?	3NT. West has 13 HCP so the total, 28-30, is plenty for game (25+) and not enough for slam (33+). West has no 4+-card major. There is no sense to look for a fit and game in diamonds. The diamonds should play well in NT and "she who knows, goes".	20250426_1.png
Q3	4/26/2025	All Pass. 3NT in the East. What is the opening lead from South?	♠4. South will pick the 4th down from her longest and strongest. This is the standard conventional lead against NT, with no bidding from her partner and no honor sequence.	20250426_1.png
Q4	4/26/2025	East see the 4♠ opening lead and the dummy hand. How should East plan the play of the hand?	The declarer counts winners in a NT contract. With the spade lead, declarer has a sure spade trick. She has the <span class="red">♥A</span> and 3 top clubs. She has 5 diamond tricks, barring a weird 5-0 split. If the ♣J behaves, there is a 4th club too.	20250426_1.png
Q5	4/26/2025	North plays the ♠A and returns the ♠3. Should East play the ♠K?	No, duck. If North happens to have 5 diamonds, South wants to be sure North is out of spades to return. South has calculated her max tricks to be 11, so losing a second spade does not hurt her.	20250426_1.png
Q6	4/26/2025	South will win the ♠Q and knock out the ♠K on trick #3. How should South continue?	After the ♠K, South will start the diamonds and find they are split. She will run 5 diamond tricks, sluffing 2 hearts from her hand. She will watch the defender's discard, trying to figure where the ♣J is.	20250426_1.png
Q7	4/26/2025	After collecting 5 diamonds, how will East go about the clubs?	The standard play is to win the ♣K, cross to the ♣Q, and lead back toward the ♣AT for a possible finesse. But the ♣J falls, so East has 4 club tricks and the <span class="red">♥A</span> at the end.	20250426_1.png
Q8	4/26/2025	Does the contract make?	Yes. East has 11 tricks in NT. In the tournament, 2 pairs somehow ended up declaring in diamonds. That wins 11 tricks too, but low boards.	20250426_1.png

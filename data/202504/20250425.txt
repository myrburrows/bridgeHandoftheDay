Q1	4/25/2025	South deals. What should South open?	1S. This is a strong opener, even though the 6 spades lack the bigs. South will go to game over 2S from North, and to 3S over 1NT.	20250425_1.png
Q2	4/25/2025	Bidding: 1S. What should West do?	Pass. West could justify bidding either a 2C overcall or a 3C preempt. The club suit is not really strong enough for either. Vulnerable, the clubs should be strong with 2 of the top 3, or 3 of the top 5. Bidding 3C probably describes the hand best, if pushy. A disciplined West should pass and await developments.	20250425_1.png
Q3	4/25/2025	Bidding: 1S, P. How does North respond?	4S. With 5 spades, less than 10 HCP, and balanced side-suits, North has plenty for a preemptive jump to game. In fact, the spades are a little too strong for this, but no other bid makes sense. North will bid the same if West throws in some club bid.	20250425_1.png
Q4	4/25/2025	Bidding: 1S, P, 4S. East will pass. Should South use Blackwood to try for slam?	No, pass. Even if North has the ♠A, there could still be 2 spade losers. North showed weak HCP, so it's unlikely the 3 red losers will find a safe home.	20250425_1.png
Q5	4/25/2025	All Pass. 4S in the South. What should West choose to lead?	7C. Never leading a red from those holdings, West has only some club to pick. It seems unlikely to make a difference which one is led. West leads the 4th down, thinking that East will see it as neither high nor low.	20250425_1.png
Q6	4/25/2025	South sees the opening club lead, and the dummy hand. How should South plan the play?	The declarer counts losers in a suit contract. South has 11 trump, so will drop the Q♠ in max 2 rounds. So, there is no spade loser and no club loser. There is 1 heart loser. In diamonds, it will be 1 or 2 losers depending on where the <span class="red">♦K</span> is.	20250425_1.png
Q7	4/25/2025	South will take the ♣A, and play 2 rounds of trumps. What strategy should South follow to maximize her chances for 11 tricks?	Suit elimination. South starts by ruffing the last club in dummy. South can play 2 extra rounds of trump just to pressure the defenders a bit. South then leads the <span class="red">♥A</span>, the <span class="red">♥K</span> and her small heart. Whichever defender wins, she has to lead diamonds (or give a ruff and sluff with a heart or club).	20250425_1.png
Q8	4/25/2025	Why does the declarer eliminate clubs and hearts, and make the defenders lead diamonds?	If West is on lead, South gets a free finesse with the <span class="red">♦Q</span>. If East wins the last heart, declarer still has the 50/50 chance with the indirect finesse.	20250425_1.png
Q9	4/25/2025	Does the contract succeed?	Yes. South wins 11 tricks, losing 1 heart and 1 diamond. The indirect finesse, against the <span class="red">♦K</span>, wins a second diamond trick.	20250425_2.png

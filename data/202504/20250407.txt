1	4/7/2025	This hand was played at the Weekley club on 4/1. Only 1 N-S in 6 tables got to the optimum. West deals and Pass. What should North open?	1S. North has a very strong hand with self-supporting Spades. If Partner responds even weakly (1NT or 2S), it is game-going.	20250407_1.png
2	4/7/2025	Bidding: P, 1S. East will Pass. How should South respond?	2H. Partner has opened and South has openers+. N-S has to get to at least game. South bids 2H (forcing) to show 5+ of them and 10+ HCP (it is an unlimited bid). South has Spade support but will hold that info for now.	20250407_1.png
3	4/7/2025	With such a strong responding hand, why doesn't South bid a 3H jump-shift?	My Partner and I play a jump-shift by responder as a weak, preemptive bid. Even playing responder's jump-shift as strong, 3H would promise 6+ good Hearts.	20250407_1.png
4	4/7/2025	Bidding: P, 1S, P, 2H, P. What should North say on the rebid?	4C! This is  a bit by elimination, as 2S, 3S, and 4S are all too weak. The jump-shift by opener shows 18+ points, and the very strong Spades and short red suits allow North to stretch a little. In SAYC, a jump-shift only promises 4+ of the second suit.	20250407_1.png
5	4/7/2025	How does South know that 4C is not Ace-asking Gerber convention?	In SAYC, 4C Gerber has a prerequisite of a natural NT bid. N-S has not bid NoTrump, so 4C by North is a jump-shift by opener. 	20250407_1.png
6	4/7/2025	Bidding: P, 1S, P, 2H, P, 4C, P. What does South say on her rebid?	4NT. This is Ace-asking Blackwood. North has 18+ so South is thinking slam if Partner has the ♠A. If No, South will sign-off in 5S. If Yes, well, she will see how many Kings North has, A grand slam could be there, and 6S should be playable if not more.	20250407_1.png
7	4/7/2025	Bidding: P, 1S, P, 2H, P, 4C, P, 4NT, P. How does North reply to Blackwood?	5D. Playing no-frills Blackwood, 5C would be all or no Aces, and 5D shows 1. If you play RKC Blackwood, you need a firm understanding with Partner as there is no agreed suit here.	20250407_1.png
8	4/7/2025	Bidding: P, 1S, P, 2H, P, 4C, P, 4NT, P, 5D, P. How does South bid now?	5NT. This is Blackwood King-asking. With the bid, South promises all the Aces are on the N-S side. If North has all 4, then 7S or 7NT should play. If North has less than 4, the 6-level should be OK.	20250407_1.png
9	4/7/2025	Bidding: P, 1S, P, 2H, P, 4C, P, 4NT, P, 5D, P, 5NT, P. How does North respond to 5NT?	6S. North has 3 Kings. Compressing the bidding a step, with the 3 Aces, South feels that NT will work for the better score, as she will be declarer and the lead will come toward her Aces. South raises to 6NT over 6S.	20250407_1.png
10	4/7/2025	Bidding: P, 1S, P, 2H, P, 4C, P, 4NT, P, 5D, P, 5NT, P, 6S, P, 6NT, P. Should North stop? Does the contract make?	Yes, Pass. South has shown no tolerance for Spades. All Pass and South is at 6NT. West leads the <span class="red">♥K</span>. South can count 6 Spades, the <span class="red">♥A</span>, 2 Diamonds, and likely 4 Clubs. It makes 13 tricks, and the grand salami was there (but hard to find with less than expert tools).	20250407_1.png

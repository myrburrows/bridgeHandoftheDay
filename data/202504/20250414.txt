Q1	4/14/2025	North deals? Should North open the bidding?	No, Pass. In first chair, especially vulnerable, North needs a full-strength opening hand. North falls short with insufficient HCP and no notable distributional feature like a long suit or singleton.	20250414_1.png
Q2	4/14/2025	Bidding: P. East will Pass. What should South open?	1NT. South promises 15-17 HCP, a balanced hand, and stoppers in at least three suits. Opening 1NT describes her hand perfectly to partner, enabling tools like Stayman and transfers. North understands South might have a worthless doubleton somewhere, and this mutual understanding is key.	20250414_1.png
Q3	4/14/2025	Bidding: P, P, 1NT. Should West bid Spades to interfere with opponent's NT?	No, Pass. With less than 10 HCP, West needs a 6-card or longer suit to interfere over 1NT. With only 5 HCP and a 5-card spade suit, West is too weak to disrupt.	20250414_1.png
Q4	4/14/2025	Bidding: P, P, 1NT, P. How should North respond to 1NT?	3NT. North has 11 HCP, which, combined with South’s 15-17, is enough for a notrump game. With no 4-card major and stoppers in all suits, 3NT is an easy choice.	20250414_1.png
Q5	4/14/2025	All Pass. 3NT by South. What should West select for the opening lead?	♠5. The fourth-highest from the longest and strongest suit is a standard lead against notrump, invoking the Rule of 11. Against a suit contract, West might lead the aggressive ♠K, but with only a two-card honor sequence, West opts for the constructive fourth-down lead, hoping to develop tricks.	20250414_1.png
Q6	4/14/2025	South sees the small spade lead and the dummy hand. How should South plan the play?	South, as declarer, counts winners in notrump. She has 1 spade, 3 hearts, and 2 club fast winners, plus 2 slow diamond winners after driving out the <span class="red">♦A</span>. South sees potential extra tricks in spades, diamonds, or clubs and needs just one of these to make 3NT.	20250414_1.png
Q7	4/14/2025	The ♠9 wins the first trick in dummy. That is a strong start toward 9 tricks. How should South proceed?	The ♠9 wins the first trick in dummy, giving South a strong start toward 9 tricks. Her first priority is diamonds. South leads the <span class="red">♦3</span>, East ducks, and South wins with the <span class="red">♦K</span>. She then leads the <span class="red">♦5</span>, West follows, and East takes the <span class="red">♦J</span> with the <span class="red">♦A</span>. Diamonds have split 3-2, securing a 10th trick for declarer.	20250414_1.png
Q8	4/14/2025	East faithfully switches to the ♠3. South will duck once in spades because she doesn’t fear any suit switch. West has nothing better to do than continue spades. What is next?	After East switches to the ♠3, South ducks once in spades, unafraid of a suit switch. West, with no better option, continues spades. After winning the ♠A, South plays two rounds of diamonds, noting two discards from East and one from West. East, out of diamonds and spades, must discard from clubs or hearts. Whichever East chooses, South exploits her length for an eleventh trick.	20250414_1.png
Q9	4/14/2025	Does the contract make?	Yes, South makes 3NT with two overtricks. She takes 2 spades, 3 hearts, 3 diamonds, and 2 clubs, plus an extra heart or club depending on East’s discards.	20250414_1.png

Q1	4/22/2025	East deals and passes. What should South open?	1NT. South has 15 HCP and a balanced 3-2-3-5 hand. In Goren-days, players would not open NT with a near-worthless doubleton like <span class="red">♥J</span>4. With computer analysis, SAYC has a broader approach, based on the power of the NT toolkit and interference with opponent's bidding. The key is that your partner knows a worthless doubleton could be part of your NT opener.	20250422_1.png
Q2	4/22/2025	Bidding: P, 1NT. Should West overcall?	No, pass. The spade suit is not strong enough to start at the 2-level. 2S would promise 6 spades, or 5 strong ones (like 2 of the top 3, or 3 of the top 5). Even with favorable vulnerability, the suit is insufficient. West does not particularly want to ask for a spade lead, should North declare in a suit.	20250422_1.png
Q3	4/22/2025	Bidding: P, 1NT. What if East had a long hesitation before her pass, and clearly was close to opening herself? Should West push a little and overcall with 2S?	No! It is shamefully unethical to use unauthorized information from your partner in bridge. There are rules against it, of course. But, for the sake of the game, West is obligated to ignore anything at all outside the actual bids. Although hesitating is a normal part of thinking, bidders must do their best to bid in tempo with no fidgeting or murmurs.	20250422_1.png
Q4	4/22/2025	Bidding: P, 1NT, P. How should North respond to her partner's 1NT opening?	Pass. North has only 6 HCP, and 2NT shows 8-9. North could invite 3NT with 6 clubs, but not with 5 small.	20250422_1.png
Q5	4/22/2025	East will pass. All Pass. 1NT in the South. What should West choose for the opening lead?	♠5. West will start with the 4th from her longest and strongest. West has entries in the other suits, behind the power in South. West hopes the spade length with turn into tricks.	20250422_1.png
Q6	4/22/2025	South see the ♠5 lead and the dummy hand comes down. How should South plan the play.	South counts winners, and has 2 spades and 2 diamonds. N-S have only 5 spades and 5 hearts, and both are likely to split 5-3 (or worse), so 2 "danger" suits. South sees her side has 10 clubs, missing only the ♣AQ3. The task will be to develop clubs before her stoppers get knocked out.	20250422_1.png
Q7	4/22/2025	South wins the opening trick in-hand. How does she play to maximize the clubs?	South hates to burn a stopper, but the best play is to cross to the <span class="red">♦A</span>, and lead a club toward the ♣KJ. If East plays the ♣3, South will play low. This way, South will only lose 2 club tricks if West has both the ♣AQ -- a 25% chance.	20250422_1.png
Q8	4/22/2025	On trick #3, South plays the ♣5 from dummy, What happens next?	The ♣Q appears, covered by the ♣K and West takes her ♣A. West continues spades. The declarer takes the ♠K and then 4 clubs	20250422_1.png
Q9	4/22/2025	Does the contract make?	Yes, South gets 2 spades and 2 diamonds, plus 4 clubs. Making +1.	20250422_2.png

1	4/10/2025	South deals. What should South open?	2NT. South has 20 HCP, stoppers, and NT distribution. It would be a mistake to start 1S, because Partner might respond 1NT. Then South can only rebid 3NT. North becomes Declarer, and South's pretty hand is exposed as Dummy. The defense could pick away at it.	20250410_1.png
2	4/10/2025	Bidding: 2NT. West will Pass. How should North respond?	3H. This is the Jacoby transfer, showing 5+ Spades. South must announce "Spades" to E-W. North has not said anything about strength. She knows that her 12 with Partner's 20-21 is in slam territory (around 33 points total).	20250410_1.png
3	4/10/2025	Bidding: 2NT, P, 3H. East will Pass. What is South's rebid?	4S. This is the Super-Sized response to the Jacoby transfer. South is saying that Spades are her best with at least 4 of them.	20250410_1.png
4	4/10/2025	Bidding: 2NT, P, 3H, P, 4S, P. What should North's next bid be?	4NT. This is Blackwood Ace-asking. North knows that have a suit fit and close to 33 points. Unless South has somehow opened 2NT with no Aces, North is going for slam in Spades.	20250410_1.png
5	4/10/2025	Bidding: 2NT, P, 3H, P, 4S, P, 4NT, P. How does South reply to 4NT Blackwood?	5H. N-S are playing old-style Blackwood. 5H says "I have 2 Aces".	20250410_1.png
6	4/10/2025	Bidding: 2NT, P, 3H, P, 4S, P, 4NT, P, 5H, P. What should North do now?	6S. North knows her side has Spades and all the Aces. But, N-S have just around 33 points. North's hand is balanced and South bid NT. So the side suits likely cannot be ruffed out, and E-W have some points somewhere. 6NT, 7S or 7NT might make, but good sense says to stop at 6S	20250410_1.png
7	4/10/2025	All Pass. 6S in the South. What should West pick for her opening lead?	♣T. West is never starting a red suit. The ♣T is as safe as she is going to find.	20250410_1.png
8	4/10/2025	South sees the ♣T lead and the anticipated Dummy. How should South plan the play?	Unless West has Qxx of trump, South can pull trump with 0 losers. There are no Club losers. A finesse-able Queen is missing in each red suit. Let's see: that is two 50/50 chances, so a 75% chance of getting one or the other. South says "that's good, but is there something better?"  Of course there is!	20250410_1.png
9	4/10/2025	This looks tough but is really easy. There is a 100% path to 12 tricks.	South takes the first Club, pulls trump in 2 rounds, then the second Club. South takes the <span class="red">♦A</span> and <span class="red">♦K</span>, then exits with a small Diamond. This is "suit elimination". Whoever has the <span class="red">♦Q</span> will be in, but has to lead something! South gets a free finesse in Hearts or a "ruff and sluff" with a Diamond or Club lead (the "eliminated" suits).	20250410_1.png
10	4/10/2025	Does the contract make?	Yes, Declarer found 12 sure tricks. Note both red Queens were off-side, so the unlucky 1 in 4 chance would have struck.	20250410_1.png

1	4/5/2025	South deals. What should South open?	1NT. This hand has it all for a 1NT opener: points, stoppers, and balanced.	20250405_1.png
2	4/5/2025	Bidding: 1NT. West will Pass. How should North respond?	3D. North tells Partner she had 5-7 HCP and 6+ Diamonds. North invites Partner to bid 3 NT with good Diamonds and stoppers elsewhere. North would need 8+ HCP to try Stayman (for Hearts). The hand is a little too good for a 2S "bust" response. That would be a relay to 3C by South and then a 3D cutoff by North.	20250405_1.png
3	4/5/2025	Bidding: 1NT, P, 3D. Should East throw in a bid here?	No, Pass. East knows South has 15-17 HCP and North only 5-7. E-W could probably compete with almost half the HCP, but the Spades just aren't good enough to start at the 3-level.	20250405_1.png
4	4/5/2025	Bidding: 1NT, P, 3D, P. What should South say on her rebid?	3NT. South should have 6 tricks in Diamonds with 10 total, and 2 side Aces. This is surely worth a shot at NT game.	20250405_1.png
5	4/5/2025	All Pass. 3NT in the South. What should West pick for the opening lead?	♠6. When opponents bid only NoTrump and minors, it is a solid bet they are not strong in the majors. West should pick 4th from the Spades with the limited info she has.	20250405_1.png
6	4/5/2025	After seeing tje Spade lead and the dummy hand, how should South plan the play?	South can see 6 Diamond tricks, ♠A, <span class="red">♥A</span>, and <span class="red">♥K</span> from the top. Case closed. South cannot mess around after her Spade stopper is knocked out on the opening lead.	20250405_1.png
7	4/5/2025	Does the contract make?	Yes. The defenders could get the first 3 tricks by leading Clubs (and 1 later), or the last 4 with the Spade lead. The result is the same.	20250405_1.png

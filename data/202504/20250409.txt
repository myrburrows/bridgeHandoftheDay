1	4/9/2025	North deals. What should North bid?	1H. North has a good opening hand with rebiddable Hearts.	20250409_1.png
2	4/9/2025	Bidding: 1H. Should East get in on the bidding?	Yes, Double. East's point are a little light for a vulnerable Takeout Double. She credits the strength in the black suits, together with the Heart void, to add up to just enough.	20250409_1.png
3	4/9/2025	Bidding: 1H, X. How should South respond?	4H. The jump to game (1H - 4H) in a major is preemptive. It shows simply lots of trump and weak points. South is spot on for the bid with only 8 HCP but 5 Hearts. The preempt especially indicated with the Takeout Double by East. 	20250409_1.png
4	4/9/2025	All Pass. 4 Hearts in the North. What should East lead?	♣A. The lead of A from A-K is a standard recommended opening. East gets to see the Dummy (and maybe a signal from Partner), and can use that to figure out what to lead next.	20250409_1.png
5	4/9/2025	North sees the opening ♣A and the Dummy comes down. How should North plan the play?	Declarer can see 2 losing Clubs, 1 Spade and the missing trump Ace. The only way off the hook would be for East to have the ♠K (likely from the bid) and be forced to lead Spades. Sadly, that is not likely. The <span class="red">♦K</span> has to be right or there will be a Diamond loser too.	20250409_1.png
6	4/9/2025	The ♣A sails around with South pitching a deceptive ♣J. What should East lead next?	♣K. East is not leading Spades or Diamonds toward that Dummy. That leaves Clubs, no matter what is going on with that ♣J appearing.	20250409_1.png
7	4/9/2025	North takes the third round of Clubs in Dummy. She leads a trump, hoping East has the <span class="red">♥A</span> and will lead a Spade. What actually happens?	West is wise enough to take the <span class="red">♥A</span> first and exit with the <span class="red">♥9</span>, to let Declarer do her own work in Spades and Diamonds.	20250409_1.png
8	4/9/2025	Does the contract make? Was this a bad contract?	As the defense would not help out, North gets the Diamond finesse but cannot avoid losing a Spade for down 1. If South is more timid in bidding, E-W could end up in 2S or 3S making. 	20250409_1.png

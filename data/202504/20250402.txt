1	4/2/2025	South deals. Should South open the bidding?	Yes, 2H. South has a good prototype for a weak-2 opening. She has strong hearts, some distribution strength and little else.	20250402_1.png
2	4/2/2025	Bidding: 2H. West will Pass. How should North respond?	4H. North knows there are 10 trumps in N-S. The Aces and ♠K should be good for Partner's likely short suits. A slam is surely out of reach, so North just jumps to game.	20250402_1.png
3	4/2/2025	Bidding: 2H, P, 4H. Should East throw in a bid?	No, Pass. East might like to interfere. but 5 Spades is not enough to start them at the 4-level.	20250402_1.png
4	4/2/2025	All Pass. 4H in the South. What should West pick for the opening lead?	♣K. It's the top of a high honor sequence. It is easily the safest for both developing tricks and for not costing the defense.	20250402_1.png
5	4/2/2025	After Declarer see the opening ♣K and the dummy comes down, how should South plan the play?	South expects to lose a Club and maybe 2 Spades. She can pull trump in 2 rounds (if they split 2-1, as they 65% will). Dummy will have 2 trump left for Club losers, and then the Spades can go as they go,	20250402_1.png
6	4/2/2025	South plays the ♣A from Dummy, and the ♥2 to the ♥K. East shows out, Hearts are 3-0, and there goes Plan A. How should South proceed?	South has to leave the trump because she needs 2 in the dummy for Clubs. South leads the ♣5, losing to West. West cannot hurt the contract. South is set to ruff her 2 remaining Clubs. If West shifts to Spades, East can take 2 rounds of those. If East continues Spades, South can afford to trump high. 	20250402_1.png
7	4/2/2025	Does the 4H make?	Yes. The defense gets 3 tricks in the black suits but that is all. South did well to see that she needed ruffs more than needing to pull trump. See the epilogue in Question #8.	20250402_1.png
8	4/2/2025	After North bid 4H, at an expert table an adventurous East bid 4S. How do you think that went?	North doubled 4S and East ran to 5D, also doubled by North. But N-S could only take ♦A and ♣A versus Diamonds. It was a very fat score for E-W compared to E-W giving up game everywhere else.	20250402_1.png

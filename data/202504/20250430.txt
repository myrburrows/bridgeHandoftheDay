Q1	4/30/2025	South deals. What should South open?	1H. South has 12 HCP, and is above the Bergen 20 with low LTC. South will open the higher ranking of 2 equal suits. She does not have the sort of powerhouse to open 1C and later reverse into hearts.	20250430_1.png
Q2	4/30/2025	Bidding: 1H. What should West overcall?	1S. West wants to leave room for East to answer. West's hand is too good for a preemptive 2S or 4S. 	20250430_1.png
Q3	4/30/2025	Bidding: 1H, 1S. How should North respond?	Double. This is a negative double. North shows the unbid suits and just enough strength to make her partner bid again. The 6 HCP is low, even for a negative double (forcing South to bid at the 2-level here). But the 5-5 shape pushes North to bid and hope to find a minor suit fit.	20250430_1.png
Q4	4/30/2025	Bidding: 1H, 1S, X. How should East advance?	4S. East has the 5 spades that this jump will show her partner. The side suits are weak and the trumps are low, but this bid is preemptive. West's overcall might not be very good, but East does not want opponents finding a fit in a minor.	20250430_1.png
Q5	4/30/2025	Bidding: 1H, 1S, X, 4S. Should South bid again?	No, pass. South knows that her side has at least 9 clubs. Even with the fit and re-evaluating for shortage points, it does not look good enough to try 5C. Not vulnerable, the penalty could still be severe. South is also looking at a good defensive layout.	20250430_1.png
Q6	4/30/2025	All Pass. 4S in the West. What should be opening lead from North be?	<span class="red">♥6</span>. North will lead her partner's bid suit. Maybe South can take 2 top hearts and North can ruff a third round. She will signal a doubleton.	20250430_1.png
Q7	4/30/2025	West sees the opening lead and then the dummy hand comes down. How should West plan the play?	Playing a suit contract, the declarer counts losers. There are no losers in spades or clubs. There is 1 diamond loser and 1 heart loser for sure. West needs to be careful not to lose 2 hearts. It's a fair bet that the <span class="red">♥A</span> and <span class="red">♥J</span> are in the South (from the bidding).	20250430_1.png
Q8	4/30/2025	West plays dummy's <span class="red">♥Q</span> on the <span class="red">♥6</span>, and South takes the <span class="red">♥A</span>. What should South lead for trick #2?	♣A. South sees the <span class="red">♥K</span> and <span class="red">♥9</span> on the board, and will not finesse her own <span class="red">♥J</span>. South switches to ♣A knowing West has at most 1 club (5 in her hand, 4+ in North and 3 in dummy).	20250430_1.png
Q9	4/30/2025	West will trump the ♣A, and pull spades in 1 round. How should West go from there?	West will lead a low diamond toward the <span class="red">♦Q</span>. If North has the <span class="red">♦K</span>, West can develop a heart sluff in diamonds. But, South has the <span class="red">♦K</span> and also the <span class="red">♥J</span> guarded. West can exit in clubs. Eventually, the <span class="red">♥J</span> will come good.	20250430_1.png
Q10	4/30/2025	Does the contract make?	Yes. West cannot avoid losing a diamond and 2 hearts. It makes 10 tricks.	20250430_1.png

Q1	4/29/2025	North deals and will pass. Should East open the bidding?	Yes, 1C. North is light on HCP, but strong clubs and a void encourage bidding. The hand makes the Bergen 20 and a hand with only 6 LTC should be opened. Even vulnerable, with this shape, East should get in on the bidding.	20250429_1.png
Q2	4/29/2025	Bidding: P, 1C. What should South say?	3H. It is reasonable to overcall 1H and hope to find game. Factors for preempt: 1) strong 7-card suit with 9 HCP is a classic look, 2) NV vs V is the best time to preempt, 3) East has opened so time to interfere, and 4) North has passed so game is less likely.	20250429_1.png
Q3	4/29/2025	Bidding: P, 1C, 3H. Should West join the fight?	No, pass. West has a good hand opposite an opener. However, she has nothing for clubs and the 6 diamonds are not strong enough to start at the 4-level. 	20250429_1.png
Q4	4/29/2025	Bidding: P, 1C, 3H, P. Should North raise it to 4H?	No, pass. North has a good hand, and N-S surely have 10 hearts between them. South will have short clubs too. But South will have less than 10 HCP for her bid, and maybe considerably less. It doesn't quite add up to 10 tricks.	20250429_1.png
Q5	4/29/2025	All Pass. East cannot rebid after the pass by her partner. 3H in the South. What should West lead first?	♣9. The singleton in her partner's bid suit is screaming to be led.	20250429_1.png
Q6	4/29/2025	South sees the opening lead and the dummy hand. How should South plan the play?	In a suit bid, the declarer will count losers. South expects to lose a club, a diamond, 2 spades and the <span class="red">♥A</span>. That is 1 too many. But if East plays the ♣A, then the ♣Q is promoted. South hopes to pitch a loser there.	20250429_1.png
Q7	4/29/2025	East plays the ♣A and the ♣K falls. What should East lead now?	East can see that there were 11 clubs between North and herself at the start. So both West and South are out. East plays a club to let her partner ruff behind the declarer.	20250429_1.png
Q8	4/29/2025	East returns the ♣J. What should South do?	South will pitch the <span class="red">♦7</span> to get rid of the diamond loser. Hopefully West has another club, If not, West will have to burn a trump here. There are only 3 hearts missing: <span class="red">♥A</span>T6.	20250429_1.png
Q9	4/29/2025	West trumps with her <span class="red">♥6</span>, and switches to the ♠Q. For her opening bid, it is a good guess that East holds the ♠K.. What should South do?	South plays the ♠A from dummy, then leads the good ♣Q. South will throw a spade loser. Unless West started with all 3 missing trump, she will be out or have to trump with the <span class="red">♥A</span>. Sadly for South, West trumps with the <span class="red">♥T</span>.	20250429_1.png
Q10	4/29/2025	Does the contract make?	No. With the mean trump break, South loses 3 tricks to West's hearts plus a club and a spade. For South, down 1 is a better result than letting E-W get a part score in diamonds.	20250429_1.png

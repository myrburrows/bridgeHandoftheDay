1	4/1/2025	South deals. How should South open?	1H. South has the needed count and a 5-card major. The Hearts are unimpressive, and the ♣Q is of dubious value. This is a minimum opener.	20250401_1.png
2	4/1/2025	Bidding: 1H. West will Pass. How should North respond?	2NT. North bids the artificial "Jacoby 2NT". She shows opening values and 4+ of the opened major.	20250401_1.png
3	4/1/2025	Bidding: 1H, P, 2NT. East will Pass. How should South rebid after Partner's 2NT?	4H. South has no singleton or void. Without that, South needs to show her strength. This is one of those "the less you have, the more you bid" situations -- 4H = minimum, 3NT = 16-17, and 3H = maximum.	20250401_1.png
4	4/1/2025	Bidding 1H, P, 2NT, P, 4H, P. Does North want to ask about slam?	No, Pass. South has shown minimum and North certainly has nothing extra. 	20250401_1.png
5	4/1/2025	All Pass. 4H in the South. What is West's opening lead?	<span class='red'>♦T</span>. It's not great, but Partner will understand it. The <span class="red">♦T</span> is not likely to cost a trick, and the sequence could develop. In general, a singleton small trump is not a good opening lead.	20250401_1.png
6	4/1/2025	After seeing the opening lead and Dummy, how should the declarer plan the play?	South sees 2 losing Spades, the ♣A, and maybe the <span class="red">♥K</span> finesse. So, it's a 50-50 chance of making. Can South improve on that? She can pitch a Spade on a Club by knocking out the Ace. She will be in with a Diamond. Should she first start Clubs or try the trump finesse?	20250401_1.png
7	4/1/2025	If she tries the trump finesse first and it loses, that means East will be in with the <span class="red">♥K</span>. East will be looking at the weak Spades in Dummy, and will surely switch. That's down 1. What should South do first?	Declarer see that the first order of business is Clubs. She takes the <span class="red">♦A</span>, and leads the ♣Q. West will take the ♣A at some point. When that is gone, South has her Spade discard set. Could E-W steal a trick by ruffing Clubs or Diamonds while the discard is developed? N-S have only 6 Diamonds and 5 Clubs total. It's only like 5% that there's a singleton out there in the minors.	20250401_1.png
8	4/1/2025	Does the 4H make?	Yes. South loses 1 Club, 1 Spade, and the <span class="red">♥K</span> when the finesse is off-side.	20250401_1.png

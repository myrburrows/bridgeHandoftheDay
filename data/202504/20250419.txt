Q1	4/19/2025	North deals. Should North open?	No, pass. North has a decent hand that is near-opening, but short.	20250419_1.png
Q2	4/19/2025	Bidding: P. Should East open the bidding?	Yes, 1C. With a strong 6-card suit and a void, East is looking for a reason to open. In spite of vulnerability, both the LTC and "Bergen 20" push for a bid. The shape of the hand overrides short HCP.	20250419_1.png
Q3	4/19/2025	Bidding: P, 1C. What should South say?	3H. South has a well-formed 3-level preempt in hearts. With favorable vulnerability and her partner's pass, South is more than willing to cut off bidding room from E-W	20250419_1.png
Q4	4/19/2025	Bidding: P, 1C, 3H. Should West say anything?	Yes, 4D. West wants to bid if she can. Her partner has openers, and N-S have shown just weakness and long hearts. With the <span class="red">♥A</span>xx, there should be no heart losers. If East has a couple of diamonds, 4D should play. If East goes back to clubs, so be it.	20250419_1.png
Q5	4/19/2025	Bidding: P, 1C, 3H, 4D. Should North join the fray?	Yes, 4H. North has 2 Aces, and she knows N-S have 10 hearts. It looks like the opponents have the money, so North will take the likely sacrifice with favorable vulnerability.	20250419_1.png
Q6	4/19/2025	Bidding: P, 1C, 3H, 4D, 4H. Should East pass, double, bid 5C or 5D?	5D. West had to have 6 or 7 diamonds to start them at the 4-level.  Qxx is enough trump, plus a void, and plus good strength in the black suits. 	20250419_1.png
Q7	4/19/2025	All pass. Neither North or South can risk 5H. The bid is 5D in the West. What should North lead?	<span class="red">♥2</span>. A heart lead is safest, and maybe a heart trick can be won before they are ruffed.	20250419_1.png
Q8	4/19/2025	West sees the heart lead and the dummy comes down. How should West plan the play?	Counting losers, the declarer can't do much about the <span class="red">♦A</span> and ♠A. West knows she cannot pull trump. She needs to take extra tricks by trumping hearts and clubs. She will take the <span class="red">♥A</span>, ruff a heart, take the ♣A, ruff a club, and then ruff her last heart. West will work from there.	20250419_1.png
Q9	4/19/2025	After 5 rounds, the hands look like this. West is in dummy, and leads the <span class="red">♦Q</span>. What happens then?	North can take the <span class="red">♦A</span> or duck, no matter. North cannot get more than the 2 Aces. With both spades and trumps split, West will soon be in to pull trump and claim after the ♠A.	20250419_2.png
Q10	4/19/2025	Does the contract make?	Yes, West can get 11 tricks after finding just the right support in dummy.	20250419_2.png

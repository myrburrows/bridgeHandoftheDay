1	4/8/2025	East deals and will Pass. How should South open the bidding?	1D. South has 14 HCP and a balanced hand. The hand is just short of opening 1NT.	20250408_1.png
2	4/8/2025	Bidding: P, 1D. Should West overcall?	No, Pass. West would like to get a strong 6-card suit into the auction, at least as a lead-directing bid. But, a 2-level overcall promises 10 HCP, and that ♥Q-♥T is of questionable value. With vulnerability raising the stakes, despite the strong Clubs, discretion seems wiser.	20250408_1.png
3	4/8/2025	Bidding: P, 1D, P. How should North respond?	1S. North is happy to get her strong Spades into the auction. The 1S bid promises only 4+ Spades and 6+ HCP, but is forcing and unlimited.	20250408_1.png
4	4/8/2025	Bidding: P, 1D, P, 1S, P. How will South rebid?	2S. N-S have a Spade fit, as South can count on at least 4 from Partner. South can add 1 point for the doubleton Heart (but has already counted 3 for the ♥K). South is not quite up to the mid-range hand (16-17 points) that would indicate a 3S "limit raise".	20250408_1.png
5	4/8/2025	Bidding: P, 1D, P, 1S, P, 2S, P. How should North respond on her rebid?	3S. North feels really good about Spades, but those side-suits are not encouraging. North knows N-S have a least 9 Spades total, and "the Law" (of Total Tricks) pushes that 9 trump = 9 tricks. North invites South to bid game with any extra strength.	20250408_1.png
6	4/8/2025	Bidding: P, 1D, P, 1S, P, 2S, P, 3S, P. Should South raise to game?	Yes, 4S. South was at the top of her 2S bid and that seems to be what Partner is asking. 	20250408_1.png
7	4/8/2025	All Pass. 4S in the South. What is the opening lead from West?	♠4. N-S took 5 steps to get to game, so West expects the defense has a chance. It is too likely to cost a trick if West starts a side-suit. West hopes she cuts some ruffing cards. She won't signal high-low as that info would likely only help Declarer.	20250408_1.png
8	4/8/2025	South sees the opening lead, and the Dummy comes down. How should South plan the play?	South counts losers first in a suit bid. South expects Spades to split, as West could never lead them with 4. It's no Spade losers and no Diamond losers. But there are 2 Hearts losers and 2 Clubs. The Hearts will depend on where the ♥A is. It looks like success just come down to that.	20250408_1.png
9	4/8/2025	Declarer will put off playing Hearts as long as possible. How can she improve her chances?	South pulls trump in 2 rounds. If the ♦J behaves (doubleton or 3-3 split), a Club from Dummy can be pitched on the ♦T. On the third round of Diamonds, Declarer has to decide to finesse for the ♦J or play for the 3-3 split. Noting that West did not reflexively signal high-low on the first 2 rounds, South correctly guesses that West started with 3.	20250408_1.png
10	4/8/2025	Does the contract make?	Yes, the Diamonds split so only 1 Club is lost. The ♥A is on-side, so Declarer is only losing 1 Heart. It makes 11 tricks.	20250408_1.png

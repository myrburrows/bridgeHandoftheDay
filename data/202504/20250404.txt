1	4/4/2025	North deals. Should North open the bidding?	Yes, 1C. In the old Goren days, this flat hand might be passed. Playing SAYC, North opens with 12 HCP, especially Not Vulnerable. Playing "standard" minors, 1D would promise 4+ of them. 1C only promises 3+.	20250404_1.png
2	4/4/2025	Bidding: 1C. Should East overcall?	Yes, 1H. East has 5 Hearts with 2 honors. It is not great but the suit is biddable. The 11 HCP is in the 1-over-1 overcall range of 8-17. With favorable vulnerability, East should bid if she can.	20250404_1.png
3	4/4/2025	Bidding: 1C, 1H. South has openers. How should South respond?	3NT. South knows that N-S have at least 25 HCP -- game-going in NT. South has 2 Heart stoppers (with East bidding them). It's unlikely to find a fit in Spades, so South is right to put it in NT game. "She who knows, goes".	20250404_1.png
4	4/4/2025	All Pass. 3NT in South. What is the opening lead from West?	♥9. This depends on partnership understanding. A widely used standard for leading Partner's bid suit is "high from 2, and low from 3+".	20250404_1.png
5	4/4/2025	After South sees the opening lead and the dummy hand is exposed, how should she plan the play?	South counts winners in NT. She sees 2 Spades, 2 Diamonds, and a Club. South will cover the ♥9 with the ♥T,  and that promotes the ♥8 to a winner (concluding East has the ♥KJ from the bidding and opening lead). That is 8 tricks, and South will look for #9.	20250404_1.png
6	4/4/2025	South can look for a 3-3 split in either minor, but that is only a 1/3 chance in each. Is there a way to improve on that?	Yes, South should lead low toward the ♣JT4. South will find a second Club trick if West has the ♣K or the ♠Q or both. That is about 70% likely. From the bidding, East may well have the ♣KQ, but nothing is lost by trying the finesse. The chance at a 3-3 split is still there.	20250404_1.png
7	4/4/2025	On the opening lead, East covers the ♥T with the ♥J, and South wins with the ♥Q. What should South lead?	Lead the ♣2. West should play the ♣7, and the ♣T loses to the ♣K in East. The outcome will be the same whatever East leads. In Dummy, Declarer will finesse Hearts and in hand she will lead a small Club toward the ♣J4. When West plays the ♣Q, the second Club trick is in.	20250404_1.png
8	4/4/2025	Does the contract make 9 tricks?	Yes, South takes 2 Spades, 3 Hearts, 2 Diamonds and 2 Clubs.	20250404_1.png

Q1	4/16/2025	West deals. Should West open the bidding?	Yes, 1S. West has only 11 HCP, and no Aces. Those factors are negatives. West reviews her LTC and "Bergen 20", and finds a very low LTC. A hand with 6 or less LTC should be opened.	20250416_1.png
Q2	4/16/2025	Bidding: 1S. North will Pass. How should East respond to 1S.	2NT. This is the artificial Jacoby 2NT. East has 4 not-great spades and a bare 12 HCP. Nevertheless, 2NT is the best description to her partner. West should "alert" this bid.	20250416_1.png
Q3	4/16/2025	Bidding: 1S, P, 2NT. South will pass. How should West rebid?	3C. The Jacoby 2NT convention calls for opener to bid a singleton or void suit on the rebid.  The responder will factor this distributional strength into her rebid.	20250416_1.png
Q4	4/16/2025	Bidding: 1S, P, 2NT, P, 3C, P. What should East say on her rebid?	4S. The jump to 4S shows a minimum Jacoby 2NT. West's club shortage, plus her own Ax diamond doubleton, does not raise East's outlook nearly enough to encourage more.	20250416_1.png
Q5	4/16/2025	Bidding: 1S, P, 2NT, P, 3C, P, 4S, P. Should West go forward with a slam try?	No, Pass. West can add 5 points for the club void, but still she is only around 16. East has promised 12-14 minimum, so it is not counting up to slam strength.	20250416_1.png
Q6	4/16/2025	All Pass. 4S in the West. What opening lead should North make?	♠6. E-W have shown opener-opposite-opener and 9 spades, but nothing extra. Maybe the declarer will struggle in the side-suits. North knows West has 0 or 1 club. The safest thing seems to be to try to cut the ruffing ability.	20250416_1.png
Q7	4/16/2025	West sees the opening trump lead and the dummy hand is exposed. How should West plan the play?	Declarer counts losers in a suit bid. West has to lose the ♠A. There would be no club or diamond losers if the number of trump was unlimited. That leaves hearts. There are possibly 2 losers if North has the <span class="red">♥K</span> and <span class="red">♥J</span>.	20250416_1.png
Q8	4/16/2025	The first challenge: what should West play from dummy on the opening ♠6 lead?	♠3. The missing trump are now Ace, ten and 8. If North started with 4, South wants to keep J-9 on the board. South plays ♠8 and West takes the ♠K. With gap-y strength in all side-suits, West can pull trump. She leads the ♠2, North takes the Ace and continues the ♠T. West takes in dummy and is down to 1 trump on the board and 2 in hand.	20250416_1.png
Q9	4/16/2025	What does West attack now?	Hearts. West knows that there is a 75% chance the either the K<span class="red">♥ </span>and J<span class="red">♥ </span>are split or both are in the South. She plays the <span class="red">♥A</span> and then a low heart. South can take the <span class="red">♥K</span>, but her <span class="red">♥J</span> will be finessed. The tough defense makes West take the diamond finesse, but even that is on-side. 	20250416_1.png
Q10	4/16/2025	Does the contract make?	Yes. West only loses the ♠A and the <span class="red">♥K</span>, and it is +1.	20250416_1.png

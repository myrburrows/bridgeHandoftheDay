Q1	4/15/2025	South deals and will pass. How should West open the bidding?	1H. West sees a self-supporting heart suit and counts 15 points. This hand is too strong for a preemptive 3H or 4H opening. South has passed, increasing the likelihood East has useful points.	20250415_1.png
Q2	4/15/2025	Bidding: P, 1H. What should North say?	Double. North has precisely the size and shape for a takeout double.	20250415_1.png
Q3	4/15/2025	Bidding: P, 1H, X. How should East respond?	4H. Even for a preemptive raise to 4H, East has the minimum strength required. Despite vulnerability, her hand has little defensive value. East pushes to game despite low HCP.	20250415_1.png
Q4	4/15/2025	Bidding: P, 1H, X, 4H. What should South advance?	4S. From her partner’s double, South knows there’s a spade fit. Her hand, with 9 HCP and a heart void, re-evaluates to 14 points. South sees a reasonable chance for game.	20250415_1.png
Q5	4/15/2025	Bidding: P, 1H, X, 4H, 4S. What should West bid, if anything?	5H. West knows her hand has little defensive value. East has shown heart support and likely some side-suit values. West, with a strong heart suit, expects 9-10 tricks, outscoring a vulnerable 4S (620).	20250415_1.png
Q6	4/15/2025	Bidding: P, 1H, X, 4H, 4S, 5H. What does North say now?	5S. North could pass and leave it to her partner, double for penalty, or push to 5S. South’s 4S shows strength—likely 5-6 good spades and near opening values. North reasons South has few wasted points in hearts, so the minors should contribute. Go for it!	20250415_1.png
Q7	4/15/2025	All Pass. 5S by South. What should West pick for the opening lead?	<span class="red">♥A</span>. West leads <span class="red">♥A</span> to cash a trick and assess the dummy from there.	20250415_1.png
Q8	4/15/2025	After seeing the <span class="red">♥A</span> lead and the dummy hand, how does South plan the play?	With no side-suit losers, South focuses on trumps. Missing the ♠A, she’ll ruff hearts and play spades to split 3-2, with the ♠Q in West. South needs 11 tricks.	20250415_1.png
Q9	4/15/2025	Declarer trumps the <span class="red">♥A</span> and leads the ♠J. Should West cover with the ♠Q?	No, duck. Covering an honor with an honor often applies, but here the ♠Q on the ♠J likely promotes South’s ♠10. West ducks to force a guess.	20250415_1.png
Q10	4/15/2025	The ♠J holds as East keeps the ♠A for the ♠K. South continues the ♠10, and finds the spades split 3-2. Does the contract make?	Yes. South’s ♠J wins, the ♠10 draws East’s ♠A, and with spades splitting 3-2, East takes ♠A and ♠9, but South claims 11 tricks.	20250415_1.png

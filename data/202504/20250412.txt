Q1	4/12/2025	West deals and passes. North will pass. How should East open the bidding?	A: 1D. This is a strong 4-4-4-1 opener. For opening, notrump is out, and the four-card heart suit is unsuitable. Both minors are biddable using "standard" minors. When opening with two equal-length suits, open the higher-ranking one, which is diamonds here.	20250412_1.png
Q2	4/12/2025	Bidding: P, P, 1D. What overcall should South make?	A: 1S. South’s hand is too strong for a weak two-level overcall. She could view her spades as self-supporting and include distribution value in her bid. With 17 points, South might consider a takeout double to force partner to bid, which works with any distribution and that point count. However, South is just shy of that strength here.	20250412_1.png
Q3	4/12/2025	Bidding: P, P, 1D, 1S. Should West support diamonds?	A: Yes, 2D. East promises at least four diamonds, ensuring a fit. Adding shortage points for the singleton, West has a respectable 10 points, making support reasonable.	20250412_1.png
Q4	4/12/2025	Bidding: P, P, 1D, 1S, 2D. How should North advance the bidding?	A: 4S. With this bid, North signals, “I have a weak hand (about 5-9 HCP) with five or more spades. I know you have at least five spades for your overcall. Though vulnerable, I’m preempting East-West—good luck!”	20250412_1.png
Q5	4/12/2025	All Pass. 4S in the South. What is the opening lead from West?	A: <span class="red">♦8</span>. West knows her side holds about half the high-card points, so she opts for an aggressive lead rather than the ♠7. She expects East to interpret the <span class="red">♦8</span> as top of nothing, based on the bidding.	20250412_1.png
Q6	4/12/2025	South takes a look at the opening lead and dummy. How should South plan the play?	A: Declarer counts losers in a suit contract. South must concede two hearts and the ♣A. She has plenty of trumps to ruff out the red suits. The outcome hinges on the ♣A’s location—favorable if East holds it, unfavorable if West does.	20250412_1.png
Q7	4/12/2025	South takes the first trick with the <span class="red">♦A</span>. She then clears trumps in one round, winning on the board. What is next?	A: <span class="red">♥4</span>. South plays this hoping the defenders will switch to a club or clash heart honors, potentially promoting the <span class="red">♥1</span>0. Neither happens—East-West force declarer to ruff by leading high red cards. She delays as long as possible, but eventually must lead a small club toward the ♣K.	20250412_1.png
Q8	4/12/2025	Does the contract make?	A: Yes. From South’s perspective, the ♣A cooperates. She loses only two hearts and one club, making the 4S contract.	20250412_1.png

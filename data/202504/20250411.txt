1	4/11/2025	North deals. The bidding goes Pass, Pass, Pass. How should West open the bidding?	1D. The West hand looks like NT, but the HCP count is between 1NT (15-17) and 2NT (20-21). West will open her only biddable suit, expecting to jump in NT next bid.	20250411_1.png
2	4/11/2025	Bidding: P, P, P, 1D. Should North throw in a 2H preempt overcall?	No, Pass. The Hearts are OK for a weak-2 bid, but 2H promises at least 5 HCP. The hand is too weak.	20250411_1.png
3	4/11/2025	Bidding: P, P, P, 1D, P. How should East respond?	2C. East shows 10+ HCP by bidding a new suit at the 2-level. As a passed hand, Partner will know she is in the 10-11 range. The Clubs aren't good, but at least there's 5 of them.	20250411_1.png
4	4/11/2025	Bidding: P, P, P, 1D, P, 2C, P. What should West's rebid be?	3NT. E-W have at least 29 HCP between them. West must bid game herself or something forcing on East. There is no new suit strong enough to start. 3NT should have a play. East can take it someplace else if she is wildly distributional.	20250411_1.png
5	4/11/2025	All Pass. 3NT in the West. What should North's opening lead be?	<span class="red">♥Q</span>. It is the top of an honor sequence and easily the preferred opener when Partner has been silent in the bidding.	20250411_1.png
6	4/11/2025	West sees the Heart lead and East's hand comes down. How should West plan the play?	Declarer counts winners in NT. There are 2 in both Hearts and Spades, plus 3 in Diamonds. West will knock out the ♣A first thing, and that is 4 more Club tricks. That's 11 tricks. West will try to finagle a 4th Diamond trick too.	20250411_1.png
7	4/11/2025	Declarer takes the <span class="red">♥A</span>, and leads the ♣K. She will continue with the ♣Q if South holds-up on the Ace -- no matter. South will return Hearts after the ♣A is played. Should West play the <span class="red">♥K</span> or hold-up?	<span class="red">♥K</span>. West doesn't need to develop any more tricks. She has 11 tricks in her sights already, and a plan to work on #12 in Diamonds.	20250411_1.png
8	4/11/2025	West will take 2 Spades, 2 Hearts, and 4 Clubs. Then she will play the <span class="red">♦A</span> and <span class="red">♦K</span> from Dummy. That's 10 tricks. The <span class="red">♦3</span> will be next. Should West finesse the <span class="red">♦J</span> or play for the split?	If North signalled a doubleton, by playing high-low on the <span class="red">♦A</span>K, then South has 4 to the <span class="red">♦J</span>. If South signalled a doubleton in Hearts, then she is more likely to be long in Diamonds. If Declarer cannot trust either one of the opponents, then a guess is needed. The distribution overall is flat so maybe 3-3, but suits split 4-2 more often than 3-3.	20250411_1.png
9	4/11/2025	Does the contract make?	Yes, with overtricks. South looks like the sort of person who would have the <span class="red">♦J</span>, so West takes the finesse and a high board.	20250411_1.png

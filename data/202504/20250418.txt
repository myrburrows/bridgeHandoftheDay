Q1	4/18/2025	West deals. What should West open?	1C. West has the count to open, and no 5+-card major. Playing "standard" minors, 1D would promise 4 diamonds.  Her partner will understand that 1C only promises 3 clubs.	20250418_1.png
Q2	4/18/2025	Bidding: 1C. Should North overcall?	No, pass. North does not have a 5+-card suit to bid. A 1S overcall here would promise 5 of them.	20250418_1.png
Q3	4/18/2025	Bidding: 1C, P. How should East respond to 1C?	1H. East bids 1H to show 4+ of them, and 6+ HCP. The new suit is of course forcing on the opener. The hand could go a lot of different ways. East will see what West has to say on her rebid.	20250418_1.png
Q4	4/18/2025	Bidding: 1C, P, 1H. South will pass. What should West do on her rebid?	2H. West has very nice hearts, but the hand is still a minimum. All those side-suits could be worth nothing at all.	20250418_1.png
Q5	4/18/2025	Bidding: 1C, P, 1H, P, 2H, P. Should East raise 2H?	No, pass. Her partner has shown a minimum, and East has nothing extra. East expects 2H to be difficult enough.	20250418_1.png
Q6	4/18/2025	Bidding: 1C, P, 1H, P, 2H, P, P. If South passes, E-W will play 2H. Should South get involved in the bidding?	Yes, double. The point is that South is in the balancing chair, and has a responsibility to keep opponents from declaring too cheaply. South is 5-4 in the unbid suits. The takeout double asks North to bid her best between spades and diamonds. South's earlier pass should tell her partner the story.	20250418_1.png
Q7	4/18/2025	Bidding: 1C, P, 1H, P, 2H, P, P, X. West cannot rebid and passes. North will bid 2S. Should East or West raise to 3H?	No, both pass. E-W know what South is up to, but do not have the strength to go to the 3-level. From the bidding, the defense should have a good chance to set North.	20250418_1.png
Q8	4/18/2025	All Pass. 2H in the North. What should East lead to start?	<span class="red">♥J</span>. The hearts are easily the safest starting point. 	20250418_1.png
Q9	4/18/2025	North see the opening <span class="red">♥J</span> and the dummy hand. How should North plan the play.	Declarer first counts losers in a suit bid. North will lose 2 hearts, a diamond, and 1 or 2 clubs (depending on where the ♣A is). So, North needs all the trump. So spades have to split 3-2 with the ♠Q finesse. Go for it.	20250418_1.png
Q10	4/18/2025	Does the contract make?	Maybe. With the trump behaving, North can get 3 spades leading trump, and ruff once in hand and once in dummy. North can also get 1 heart and 1 diamond for 7 tricks, and possibly a club. Up or down, the result is better than giving in to 2H for 110 E-W.	20250418_1.png

Q1	4/21/2025	North deals. Should North open the bidding?	No, pass. North has both the suit length and HCP for a weak-2 preemptive opening. But the suit quality of the diamonds is not good enough. 2D would promise either 2 of the top 3, or 3 of the top 5.	20250421_1.png
Q2	4/21/2025	Bidding: P. What should East bid?	1NT. East has a balanced hand and the top of the 1NT HCP range.	20250421_1.png
Q3	4/21/2025	Bidding: P, 1NT. South will pass. How should West respond to 1NT?	2NT. West invites 3NT from her partner. West will lean a little toward 3C, which would invite East to bid 3NT only with good clubs. But the range for a 2NT response is 8-9 HCP, and West is there (barely).	20250421_1.png
Q4	4/21/2025	Bidding: P, 1NT, P, 2NT, P. What should East say on her rebid?	3NT. West invited, and East is at the top of the range.	20250421_1.png
Q5	4/21/2025	All pass. 3NT is in the East. What should South lead first?	<span class="red">♥5</span>. South picks 4th from her longest and strongest.	20250421_1.png
Q6	4/21/2025	East see the opening lead and the dummy hand comes down. How should East plan the play?	East counts winners in NT. "Fast winners" are 1 spade, 1 heart, and 2 clubs. East has slow winners in clubs. The first issue is the heart lead. It's a good guess that South has 5 of them, judging from the lead. That leaves 2 for North. So, if North covers, South will duck once. 	20250421_1.png
Q7	4/21/2025	North plays the <span class="red">♥Q</span> first, and returns the <span class="red">♥4</span>. East plays the <span class="red">♥A</span>. Now what?	♣K. The declarer will next finesse for the ♣Q. The idea is that if the finesse loses, North will be on lead with no more hearts. Unless South has the <span class="red">♦A</span>, North will have to let East get back to dummy in spades or diamonds.	20250421_1.png
Q8	4/21/2025	The ♣K sails around on trick #3, followed by the ♣T. What happens?	South will duck, and East plays dummy's ♣J. When North plays low, the clubs are set. The declarer plays the ♣A and 3 more rounds of clubs. East watches the discards like a hawk.	20250421_1.png
Q9	4/21/2025	Does the contract make?	Yes. As N-S are squeezed on what to pitch on the long clubs, East can place the ♠K in the North. With that finesse on-side too, South loses only the <span class="red">♥Q</span> and the <span class="red">♦A</span>.	20250421_2.png

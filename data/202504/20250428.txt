Q1	4/28/2025	West deals and passes. How should North open the bidding?	1S. The 5 spades are not great. North has a minimum opener, but an opener nonetheless.	20250428_1.png
Q2	4/28/2025	Bidding: P, 1S. East will pass. How should South respond to 1S?	2H. The hearts are too good to leave out. The spades will be there if North gives a weak 2S or 2NT rebid. The diamond void adds 5 points in either hearts or spades. South now has a max hand and a sure fit. South is thinking slam possibilities.	20250428_1.png
Q3	4/28/2025	Bidding: P, 1S, P, 2H, P. What will North say on her rebid?	3H. Her partner has promised 6 hearts and North is not sad to give up on spades. The <span class="red">♥A</span>T9 is strong, but still the hand is in the minimum range as opener.	20250428_1.png
Q4	4/28/2025	Bidding: P, 1S, P, 2H, P, 3H, P. How should South rebid?	4NT. Her partner likes hearts, and N-S are in the 30+ point range. Playing plain Blackwood, South knows the diamond void is going to be hard to evaluate. South calculates that if North has 2 Aces, then to go for 6H.	20250428_1.png
Q5	4/28/2025	Bidding: P, 1S, P, 2H, P, 3H, P, 4NT, P. How does North reply to 4NT Blackwood.	5D. It is simple counting, and 5C would be all Aces or none. 5D shows 1 Ace.	20250428_1.png
Q6	4/28/2025	Bidding: P, 1S, P, 2H, P, 3H, P, 4NT, P, 5D, P. South has taken the captaincy of the bidding. Does she cutoff at 5H or 6H?	5H. With just 2 of the Aces, South thinks 11 tricks will be challenge enough.	20250428_1.png
Q7	4/28/2025	All Pass. 5H in the South. What should West pick for the opening lead?	♣A. This is not easy. West heard the declarer ask for Aces, and then cut off. It seems likely that the defense has 2 quick tricks so West will try for #1. She won't underlead the ♣A. The <span class="red">♦T</span> might be the best lead, but that's a guess.	20250428_1.png
Q8	4/28/2025	South see the opening ♣A and the dummy hand. How should South plan the play?	The declarer will lose the ♣A. South has 9 hearts and 9 spades. South has to address trump first. South can actually deal with East having all 4 missing hearts but not if West has them.  If West has a stack, it will come down to hoping for a spade split.	20250428_1.png
Q9	4/28/2025	West wins ♣A and notes her partner's signal. West continues the ♣J, and that is won by South. How does South play next?	South should lead low toward the <span class="red">♥A</span>, and lead the 9<span class="red">♥ </span>back. When East plays low, South ducks also. Why? There is only a 15% probability of both spades and hearts splitting 2-2. If West has the <span class="red">♥Q</span>, at least it means East is out of trump and cannot ruff a returned club. South will still have a chance in spades.	20250428_1.png
Q10	4/28/2025	Does the contract make?	Yes. South finessed to get all the hearts, and then finds the spades split. South only lost the ♣A for 12 tricks.	20250428_1.png

1	4/3/2025	West will deal and Pass, followed by Pass and Pass by North and East. What should South open?	2NT. South has the points and the distribution for a 2NT (20-21 HCP) opening. The shape (3-4-3-3) and the Qxx in Clubs are concerns.	20250403_1.png
2	4/3/2025	Bidding: P, P, P, 2NT, P. How should North respond? 	3NT. North has 5 HCP so it's a total of 25-26 for N-S. That is game-going in NT. There is no 4-card major (or any suit interest, really). North expects Partner will not appreciate the flat shape, but it is what it is.	20250403_1.png
3	4/3/2025	All Pass. 3NT in the South. What should be the opening lead for West?	♠2. Clubs is a much stronger suit, but West is never underleading the K-J. The ♠2 is at least telling Partner she has 4 of them (4th down).	20250403_1.png
4	4/3/2025	After seeing the Spade lead and the dummy hand, how should South plan the play?	South counts winners in NT. She has 3 Spades, 3 Diamonds and a Heart cold. If South can finesse the <span class="red">♥J</span> and get the <span class="red">♦J</span> to behave, that's 9 tricks. Declarer worries that East will get in to lead Clubs. South has a couple of entries in Diamonds, and will lead Hearts toward her hand. She goes up with the ♠K to lead the <span class="red">♥2</span>.	20250403_1.png
5	4/3/2025	What is East thinking on defense?	East knows South has 20-21 HCP. She sees 5 in the dummy and has 10 herself. That leaves 4 or 5 HCP for West. Hmmm, where are those? Not in Spades, as the Rule of 11 says there are 9 cards bigger than the ♠2 out. West see 3 in Dummy, and 3 in her hand. South plays the ♠J under the King so South has the bigs.	20250403_1.png
6	4/3/2025	East plays low on the <span class="red">♥2</span> and South takes the <span class="red">♥Q</span>. She plays the <span class="red">♦A</span> and <span class="red">♦K</span>, and then low toward the <span class="red">♦Q</span>. What happens next?	West shows out on Diamond #3, bad luck. South plays the <span class="red">♦Q</span>, and leads the <span class="red">♥6</span>. She still hopes to hook the <span class="red">♥J</span> for 8 tricks and maybe will get lucky in Clubs.	20250403_1.png
7	4/3/2025	What should East play on the second Heart lead?	<span class="red">♥A</span>. East cashes the good <span class="red">♦J</span>, and it is time for Clubs. The honors in Spades, Hearts and Diamonds are accounted for. West's HCP must be in Clubs, and now West is marked for the ♣K. East leads the ♣A and then the ♣T.	20250403_1.png
8	4/3/2025	Does the contract make?	No. The defense will get 4 Clubs, plus the <span class="red">♥A</span> and <span class="red">♦J</span>. 3NT was the correct bid, but sunk by having no suit to work.	20250403_1.png

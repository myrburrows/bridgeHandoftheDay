Q1	5/1/2025	West deals. What should West open?	1H. West has a good 5-card suit and opening count (HCP, Bergen 20, and LTC).	20250501_1.png
Q2	5/1/2025	Bidding: 1H. North will pass, hoping E-W stick with hearts. How should East respond?	1S. East has not much for HCP, but something positive to say in spades.Her HCP range is 6-16.	20250501_1.png
Q3	5/1/2025	Bidding: 1H, P, 1S. How should South overcall?	2D. South has a strong hand that is too good to pass. 2D promises 6 of them, but 5 very strong is the best choice here. A double here would mislead North, showing the unbid suits (clubs, not so much).	20250501_1.png
Q4	5/1/2025	Bidding: 1H, P, 1S, 2D. Should West rebid?	No, pass. West doesn't have anything to show beyond the opening bid, and spade support is not there.	20250501_1.png
Q5	5/1/2025	Bidding: 1H, P, 1S, 2D, P, P. East is in the balancing chair. Should East rebid?	No, pass. East hand actually looks best as a defender with 4 trump and a side singleton.	20250501_1.png
Q6	5/1/2025	All pass. 2D in the South. What should West pick for the opening lead.	<span class="red">♥A</span>. Leading from A-K is a good choice. There is not much risk for West, and she will get a look at the dummy. 	20250501_1.png
Q7	5/1/2025	South see the opening lead and the dummy hand. How should she plan the play?	Declarer counts losers, and sees a spade, 2 hearts, and 1 or 2 clubs. She only has 6 trump so there are 7 outstanding. There's a bridge saying "the weaker your trump, the more important to run them". South basically has to pray for the 4-3 split.	20250501_1.png
Q8	5/1/2025	The <span class="red">♥A</span> sails around with East playing the <span class="red">♥T</span>. What should West play next?	<span class="red">♥9</span>. West knows either her partner or South is out of hearts. West does not want to promote that <span class="red">♥Q</span>. But, changing suits seems likely to cost a trick too. West takes a chance that it was East with the singleton.	20250501_1.png
Q9	5/1/2025	Should South cover with the <span class="red">♥Q</span>?	Yes, and East will trump. East will lead back spades hoping West has an honor.	20250501_1.png
Q10	5/1/2025	Does the contract make?	Yes. South wins the ♠Q then runs the top trump. They all fall!  South can lead the ♣J for the successful finesse. She can lead the last spade from dummy to hook the ♠AJ. South loses 1 club, 1 heart, 1 ruff, and 2 spades. Making 2.	20250501_1.png

Q1	5/6/2025	East deals. What should East open?	1S. This hand -- 7 strong spades, good hearts and a void -- is far too good for a 3S preempt. East will save the preempts for weak hands, and let things develop with this better one.	20250506_1.png
Q2	5/6/2025	Bidding: 1S. South will pass. How should West respond to 1S?	1NT. West is in the 6-9 HCP range with a balanced hand. She does not have spade support for 2S.	20250506_1.png
Q3	5/6/2025	Bidding: 1S, P, 1NT. Should North overcall?	Yes, 2C. North has opening count. The clubs are not great but there are 6 of them. There could be a part score for N-S if a club fit is found.	20250506_1.png
Q4	5/6/2025	Bidding: 1S, P, 1NT, 2C. What should the rebid be for East?	3S. East wants to invite game. If West has 8 or 9 HCP and a couple of spades, there is a good chance for game. If it is passed out, 3S should not be a disaster. East's shape is a little too good for 2S.	20250506_1.png
Q5	5/6/2025	Bidding: 1S, P, 1NT, 2C, 3S. South will pass. Should West raise to 4S?	Yes, 4S. West is borderline, but decides to raise based on the Qx of spades. East should be up around 17 points for her bid, and West hopes she adds just enough for gme.	20250506_1.png
Q6	5/6/2025	All Pass. 4S in the East. What should the opening lead from South be?	♣A. South has an easy choice after North has bid clubs.	20250506_1.png
Q7	5/6/2025	East sees the ♣A opening lead and the dummy hand. How should East plan the play?	The declarer counts losers in a suit bid. East will lose 2 clubs and a heart. There are no diamonds to lose, and spades (9 with 3 top) should be ok. The challenge will be to avoid losing a second heart.	20250506_1.png
Q8	5/6/2025	South wins the ♣A and ♣Q. South hopes to trump a third round of clubs. Not wanting to underlead the <span class="red">♦K</span>, she tries the <span class="red">♥2</span>. North takes the <span class="red">♥A</span> and leads the ♣K. What should East do?	The heart risk is solved, as <span class="red">♥A</span> is gone and East has the rest of bigs. But what to do with the ♣K lead? East is 100% sure South is out of clubs too. East trumps with the ♠8. If South has the ♠J (a 50-50 chance), the contract does down 1. In this case, South cannot over-trump.	20250506_1.png
Q9	5/6/2025	Does the contract make?	Yes. The declarer collects 7 trump tricks and 3 in hearts.	20250506_1.png

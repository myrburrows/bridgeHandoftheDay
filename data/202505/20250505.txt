Q1	5/5/2025	North deals and will pass. East passes. How should South open the bidding?	1H. South has a 6-card major and a diamond void. South is over the Bergen 20, and has only 6 LTC. Especially in 3rd chair, she has an easy decision to bid.	20250505_1.png
Q2	5/5/2025	Bidding: P, P, 1H. What is the best overcall for West?	2D. West has strength in both minors, and opening count. If clubs and diamonds were equal length and strength, West would bid 2C. The diamonds are significantly stronger, and in overcalls suit quality is more in focus.	20250505_1.png
Q3	5/5/2025	Bidding: P, P, 1H, 2D. Should North respond to 1H by South?	No, pass. 2S would promise 5 good spades, and 10 HCP. North does not have that. 2S would also deny hearts, and the <span class="red">♥K</span> with the <span class="red">♥Q</span> is the best feature of the hand. 	20250505_1.png
Q4	5/5/2025	Bidding: P, P, 1H, 2D, P. Should East advance the bidding after her partner's 2D overcall?	3D. East weighs the risk of being vulnerable, and having anemic diamonds and low HCP. But, E-W have at least 10 total diamonds! West could be very strong. East's initial pass should somewhat limit partner's expectations, and decides to interfere with possible majors in N-S.	20250505_1.png
Q5	5/5/2025	Bidding: P, P, 1H, 2D, P, 3D. Should South bid again?	No, pass. The heart suit is not good enough to bid at the 3-level without help from North.	20250505_1.png
Q6	5/5/2025	Bidding: P, P, 1H, 2D, P, 3D, P. Should West bid again?	No, pass. West can add 4 shortage points for the majors. That makes her 16 with a max of 11 in East. 27 is not 29 (target for game in a minor). There isn't justification for inviting game with a 4D bid.	20250505_1.png
Q7	5/5/2025	All Pass. 3D in the West. What should North choose for the opening lead?	<span class="red">♥K</span>. It's an easy choice. West leads high from touching honors in her partner's bid suit.	20250505_1.png
Q8	5/5/2025	West see the opening <span class="red">♥K</span> lead, and the dummy hand. How should West plan the play?	The declarer counts losers in a suit contract. West has to lose a spade and a heart. A club loser depends on who has the ♣K. West will win the <span class="red">♥A</span> and clear trump.	20250505_1.png
Q9	5/5/2025	It takes her 3 rounds to knock out the trump. How should the declarer proceed?	West will win the last round of diamonds in the dummy and lead the ♣Q. South can hold up or go up, but West's 5 clubs are going to run. She sluffs 3 spades from dummy.	20250505_1.png
Q10	5/5/2025	Does the contract make?	Yes, it makes 12 tricks, losing only a heart at the end. The hand only makes 10 tricks if the ♣K is off-side or if clubs don't break West's way.	20250505_1.png

Q1	5/15/2025	North deals. Should North open the bidding?	Yes, 1S. True, the HCP count is low. North weighs in the Bergen 20, the LTC, the 7 spades, and singleton <span class="red">♥A</span>. This hand is too good for a preempt and too good to pass, even vulnerable.	20250515_1.png
Q2	5/15/2025	Bidding: 1S. East will pass. How should South respond to 1S?	2D. With North's open, N-S have game-going count. South bids the natural and forcing 2D. That leaves North room to bid 2H or 2NT, if her partner is somewhat balanced.	20250515_1.png
Q3	5/15/2025	Bidding: 1S, P, 2D. West will pass. What should the rebid be from North?	2S. North's 7 spades are surely rebiddable.	20250515_1.png
Q4	5/15/2025	Bidding: 1S, P, 2D, P, 2S, P. What should the rebid be from the responder?	3H. This is again a natural and forcing new suit. South shows a strong hand with a likely 5-5 in the red suits.	20250515_1.png
Q5	5/15/2025	Bidding: 1S, P, 2D, P, 2S, P, 3H, P. What should North say now?	3S. North promises 7 spades. The Qxx in clubs, and only 3 red cards, does not bode well for NoTrump.	20250515_1.png
Q6	5/15/2025	Bidding: 1S, P, 2D, P, 2S, P, 3H, P, 3S, P. What should South say now?	4S. South has at least the one trump and the side singleton ace. North bid spades 3 times so South thinks that game should have a chance.	20250515_1.png
Q7	5/15/2025	All Pass. 4S is the contract with North as the declarer. What should East lead?	♣5. East can't afford to start spades, and does not want to underlead honors in the red suits. It is not great to underlead a king, but clubs is the unbid suit. 	20250515_1.png
Q8	5/15/2025	North sees the opening small club and dummy's hand comes down. How should North plan the play?	In a suit contract, the declarer counts losers. Firstly, North hopes to avoid any club losers by trumping one and pitching another on the <span class="red">♥K</span>. There is a diamond loser. If spades behave, the defenders will only get 2 trump tricks.	20250515_1.png
Q9	5/15/2025	North wins the ♣A, crosses to the <span class="red">♥A</span>, and leads a club to trump. North calls for the <span class="red">♥K</span> to pitch her last club. Now what?	North leads a heart to ruff, and then the ♠A. If trump split 3-2, there are no problems. They do! E-W will be in on the second round of trump, but cannot defeat the contract. North will ruff again, and clear the last outstanding spade.	20250515_1.png
Q10	5/15/2025	Does the contract make?	Yes, 10 tricks come home for the declarer. North loses 2 spades, and eventually the diamond finesse fails.	20250515_1.png

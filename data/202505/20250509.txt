Q1	5/9/2025	South deals and picks up this monster. What should South open?	2C. South has an NT-looking hand with HCP between opening 2NT (20-21) and 3NT (25-27). South bids the artificial and forcing 2C, and expects to bid 2NT on her rebid.	20250509_1.png
Q2	5/9/2025	Bidding; 2C. It is always fun to interfere with a 2C opener. Can West overcall?	No, pass. West has a decent hand and 5 good (not great) clubs. E - W are bidding SAYC with no special agreement that fits. 	20250509_1.png
Q3	5/9/2025	Bidding: 2C, P. How should North respond to 2C?	2D. This is SAYC 2D-holding. North shows no 5-card suit and less than 8 HCP. 	20250509_1.png
Q4	5/9/2025	Bidding: 2C, P, 2D. East will pass. What should South rebid?	2NT. As expected, South shows her balanced hand with 22-24 HCP.	20250509_1.png
Q5	5/9/2025	Bidding: 2C, P, 2D, P, 2NT, P. What should North say on her rebid?	3C. This is Stayman, just as if her partner had opened 2NT. North is looking for a fit in spades.	20250509_1.png
Q6	5/9/2025	Bidding: 2C, P, 2D, P, 2NT, P, 3C, P. How should South respond to Stayman?	3H. With 4 hearts and 4 spades, 3H is the correct reponse. 	20250509_1.png
Q7	5/9/2025	Bidding: 2C, P, 2D, P, 2NT, P, 3C, P, 3H, P. What should North say now?	3NT. South has 4 hearts but didn't say anything about spades. With all that strength, hopefully South won't need much help.	20250509_1.png
Q8	5/9/2025	Bidding: 2C, P, 2D, P, 2NT, P, 3C, P, 3H, P, 3NT. Should South stop there and play 3NT?	No, 4S. South knows that North has 4 spades, as she didn't like hearts. South knows that her partner is weak, and her own club doubleton looks high risk in NT. It's likely to play better in the spade fit.	20250509_1.png
Q9	5/9/2025	All Pass. 4S in the South. What should West select for the opening lead?	♠2. West is likely to get 3 tricks on her own and she knows the declarer has a powerhouse. Sadly, East's hand is likely a bust. West cannot give South any help in the side-suits. Knowing N - S have 8 spades, she will just try to cut ruffs. When West gets back in with hearts or clubs, she'll lead ♠A and ♠3 to exit.	20250509_1.png
Q10	5/9/2025	Will the contract make?	Yes. South is safe when trump split 3-2. She loses a trump, a heart and a club only. Note that 3NT goes down when clubs are the opening lead.	20250509_1.png

Q1	5/10/2025	West deals and passes. Should North open the bidding?	No, pass. 11 HCP is not 12, and there is no strong push from the Bergen 20 or LTC. In 3rd chair, North might fudge to open. But, 1st and 2nd chair openers should be solid.	20250510_1.png
Q2	5/10/2025	East will pass. After 3 passes, what should South open?	1D. South does not have the right count for NT. South wants her partner to trust her bids, so South sticks to the plan. Some NT-mad bidders might subtract 1 point for no club stopper, and self-justify a 1NT bid here. It might work out but will deduct from the partnership trust account.	20250510_1.png
Q3	5/10/2025	Bidding: P, P, P, 1D, P. How should North respond to 1D?	3D. With the jump to 3D, North promises 4 diamonds and 10-12 HCP. That is invitational and spot-on to this hand. The other candidate bids don't work. 2C could be passed out, and there's not enough length for 3C. 2NT could be passed out to a really bad contract if South is at the minimum.	20250510_1.png
Q4	5/10/2025	Bidding: P, P, P, 1D, P., 3D, P. What should the rebid from South be?	3NT. N - S have at least 28 points between them There should be game, if North has balanced strength at all. South thinks that partner will rescue back to diamonds if North is very distributional.	20250510_1.png
Q5	5/10/2025	All Pass. 3NT in the South. What should be the opening lead from West?	♠3.  The best West can do is 4th down from her longest and strongest. Diamonds were bid twice by N - S. In general, it is wise to lead a major suit vs NT. The sense is that the declarers would have bid a major suit if they had strength there.	20250510_1.png
Q6	5/10/2025	South sees the opening lead and then the dummy hand comes down. How should South plan the play?	The declarer counts winners in NT. With the spade lead, she has 2 spades. There are 4 heart winners and the 2 minor suit Aces. There are 2 or 3 added winners in diamonds. South plans to knock out the <span class="red">♦K</span> before her last spade stopper goes away.	20250510_1.png
Q7	5/10/2025	South wins the ♠Q on the first trick. How should she proceed?	South will cross to dummy in hearts, and lead the <span class="red">♦Q</span>. South will duck, and West will collect the <span class="red">♦K</span>. 	20250510_1.png
Q8	5/10/2025	West leads another spade and South is in with the ♠A. What happens then?	Exposed in spades, South will take her winners -- 2 spades, 4 hearts, 3 diamonds and ♣A.	20250510_1.png
Q9	5/10/2025	Does the contract make?	Yes, 10 tricks in NT.	20250510_1.png

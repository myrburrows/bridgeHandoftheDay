Q1	5/12/2025	West deals. What should West open?	1C. West intends to jump-shift to 2S on her next bid. The jump-shift by opener will show 17-19 HCP and a 2-suit hand. With the singleton <span class="red">♦A</span>, West is a little too strong for 1S. If she opens 1S and partner responds 1NT, it may be hard to get to the best contract.	20250512_1.png
Q2	5/12/2025	Bidding: 1C. North will pass. How should East respond?	1D. East can show her 5-card suit and is only promising 6+ HCP.	20250512_1.png
Q3	5/12/2025	Bidding: 1C, P, 1D. South will pass. What will West rebid as opener?	2S, as planned. This is aggressive. In SAYC, the jump-shift by opener is game forcing. If East rebids 2NT or 3D, West will have a dilemma. 	20250512_1.png
Q4	5/12/2025	Bidding: 1C, P, 1D, P, 2S, P. What should East rebid as responder?	3S. East's hand is a lot better with the spade fit. East shows her 3-card spade support, as partner has shown a likely 5-5 in spades and clubs.	20250512_1.png
Q5	5/12/2025	Bidding: 1C, P, 1D, P, 2S, P, 3S, P. Should West bid 4S or try to find a slam?	4S. East has only promised 3 spades and 6-10 points. West cannot see a promising path to 12 tricks.	20250512_1.png
Q6	5/12/2025	All Pass. 4S in the West. What should North pick for the opening lead?	<span class="red">♦9</span>. This is tough. West has 10 black cards, but maybe North can steal a trick with an over-ruff in diamonds. North will not underlead the <span class="red">♥K</span> and West showed club strength. Trump could be the best lead, but could also help the declarer with a spade guess.	20250512_1.png
Q7	5/12/2025	West see the opening lead and the dummy hand comes down. How should West plan the play?	With limitless trump, West could lose 1 heart, run trump, and cross-ruff out the minors. Sadly for West, she has only 8 spades. West will try to take tricks with all 8 trumps, plus the 3 side-suit aces.	20250512_1.png
Q8	5/12/2025	West wins the first trick with the <span class="red">♦A</span>. How should she proceed?	West will play the ♣A, ruff a club, ruff a diamond in hand (noting the doubleton signal from North), and ruff another club. That is 5 tricks. She calls for another diamond from dummy.	20250512_1.png
Q9	5/12/2025	Should West trump low or high on the third round of diamonds?	Trump high. If North started with 2 diamonds, she would over-ruff and lead trump. That would cause no end of problems. By trumping with the ♠J, she can still ruff a club, cash the <span class="red">♥A</span>, and take the top 2 trump for tricks 9 and 10.	20250512_1.png
Q10	5/12/2025	Does the contract make?	Yes. By avoiding the risk from an over-ruff, West found a path to making game. She was not too greedy.	20250512_1.png

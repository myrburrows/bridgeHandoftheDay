Q1	5/16/2025	West deals and passes. What should North open?	2NT. North has a balanced hand in the 2NT opening HCP range (20-21). North has reasonable stoppers everywhere.	20250516_1.png
Q2	5/16/2025	Bidding: P, 2NT. East will pass. What should South respond?	3H. This is a Jacoby transfer to 3S. The opener should announce "Spades". With 4 hearts and 5 spades, South might bid Stayman. But with this weak hand and anemic hearts, this hand looks like spades or notrump only.	20250516_1.png
Q3	5/16/2025	Bidding: P, 2NT, P, 3H, P, 3S, P. What should South say on her rebid?	3NT. South shows exactly 5 spades. North will choose between playing it in NT, or returning to spades with 3+ of them. 	20250516_1.png
Q4	5/16/2025	Bidding: P, 2NT, P, 3H, P, 3S, P, 3NT, P. What should North say now?	4S. North properly goes with the spade fit. South's hand will be valuable in spades, and may be of little help in NoTrump. The doubleton heart is also a concern in notrump, and may be a plus in spades.	20250516_1.png
Q5	5/16/2025	All Pass. 4S is the contract and North (with the transfer) is the declarer. What should East lead?	♠A. This lead is aggressive and could be overly so. But, North has a big hand and any side-suit lead may hurt her partner. East knows N-S has likely 8 spades, and that leaves her partner with two. E-W can't expect any ruffing tricks anyway. East will lead the Ace and then exit with a small spade.	20250516_1.png
Q6	5/16/2025	North sees the ace of trump lead, and then sees the dummy hand. How should North plan the play?	Declarer counts losers in a suit contract. North does not appreciate being down to 1 trump in dummy and 3 in hand after trick #2. She has to lose a heart. North could cross-ruff the rest with an unlimited supply of trump.	20250516_1.png
Q7	5/16/2025	What does North do after winning the second spade?	North will take stock of how many winners she has. North can take 4 in the minors and 1 in hearts. She already has a trump trick, and 3 more spade winners. But, she needs to trump a heart in hand to get to ten.	20250516_1.png
Q8	5/16/2025	North leads a heart, intent on trumping the third round of hearts in hand.  How does that go?	The contract would be in trouble if the defender with the <span class="red">♥A</span> had another trump to lead. But the last spade is in East's hand, and West can only put the declarer on lead. North will clear her last heart, and eventually trump a something in a minor suit to lead a heart. 	20250516_1.png
Q9	5/16/2025	Does the contract make?	Yes, in spite of the good trump attack by East, North loses only a spade and two hearts.	20250516_1.png

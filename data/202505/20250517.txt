Q1	5/17/2025	East deals. Should East open the bidding?	No, pass. East is just short of opening point count by all measures. With no 5+-card suit and vulnerable, East should pass and await developments.	20250517_1.png
Q2	5/17/2025	Bidding: P. South will pass. Should West open?	Yes, 1C. West is light on HCP and Bergen 20. But West has a decent 5-card suit and "third hand, bid if you can". In vulnerable status, West is borderline. East will understand that the open could be a light one.	20250517_1.png
Q3	5/17/2025	Bidding: P, P, 1C. Should North overcall?	Yes, 1S. North is in the HCP range (8-16) for a 1-level overcall. North wants to get her 5-card major into the action.	20250517_1.png
Q4	5/17/2025	Bidding: P, P, 1C, 1S. What should be the response from East?	2D. East's bid of 2D shows 10 or 11 HCP, and good 4+ diamonds. The diamonds are not great, but East has to show her near-opener. There is no other bid that makes sense, as West has only promised 3 clubs.	20250517_1.png
Q5	5/17/2025	Bidding: P, P, 1C, 1S, 2D. Should South throw in a bid?	Yes, 2S. There is a spade fit in N-S, and South thinks both sides must have about equal strength. Spades should have a good chance at 8 tricks.	20250517_1.png
Q6	5/17/2025	Bidding: P, P, 1C, 1S, 2D, 2S. What should the rebid be from West?	2NT. With North on lead, West expects to have 2 spade stoppers. East showed 10-11 HCP. If West has one of the top clubs, there should be 4 clubs and 2 spades. West thinks she can find a couple of tricks in the red suits.	20250517_1.png
Q7	5/17/2025	Should North or South bid again? Should East raise to 3NT?	No, All Pass. Neither North nor South have the quality spades to rebid them. East has nothing to offer beyond her first bid. With no help in the majors, East will leave it at 2NT.	20250517_1.png
Q8	5/17/2025	All Pass. 2NT is the contract, and West is the declarer. What is the opening lead from North?	♠5. North will try to develop spades to set the contract, and leads 4th down. South supported spades so maybe West only has 1 stopper for her NT bid.	20250517_1.png
Q9	5/17/2025	West sees the 5♠ lead, and the dummy comes down. How should West plan the play?	The declarer counts winners in a NT contract. There are 2 spade winners and 2 diamonds. There are 4 club winners, once the ♣A is knocked out. West takes the first trick in dummy, then West will unblock the ♣K at trick #2. 	20250517_1.png
Q10	5/17/2025	Does the contract make?	Yes, West has 2NT cold. In fact, the defense will have to be careful not to lose an added red trick at the end.	20250517_1.png

Q1	5/2/2025	South deals. What should South open?	1H. South has the 8-card suit and outside void, so it is a good shape for a 4H preempt. But, 4H will likely cutoff North as well as E-W. With the <span class="red">♦A</span>, South wants to find out if her partner has some strength toward slam, before jumping to game.	20250502_1.png
Q2	5/2/2025	Bidding: 1H. West will pass. How should North respond?	1S. North has a 6-card suit and 6+ HCP. North is just short of openers, so is hoping for a game (maybe NT?).	20250502_1.png
Q3	5/2/2025	Bidding: 1H, P, 1S. Should East get involved in the bidding?	Yes, double. This is risky, promising openers and support for the unbid suits. What if West says 2D? East is a bit of a risk-taker, but she thinks the worst case is balanced by her strong hand and hope for a club fit. East makes a strictly "not vulnerable" move, and will pass 2D if it comes to that.	20250502_1.png
Q4	5/2/2025	Bidding: 1H, P, 1S, X. What is South's rebid?	4H. South is less-than-thrilled with that round of bidding, but 3H has like a 95% chance of being passed by North.  South should have some good play for game with North's 6+ HCP. She would have opened 4H in the first place, so why not now?	20250502_1.png
Q5	5/2/2025	All pass. 4H in the South. What should West select for the opening lead?	♠Q. West picks an aggressive lead. If North has both the ♠AK, so be it. If East has either the ♠A or ♠K, this should build toward a trick.	20250502_1.png
Q6	5/2/2025	South sees the opening ♠Q and the dummy hand. How should she plan the play?	The declarer counts losers in a suit bid. South has no spade and no diamond losers. There are 1 or 2 clubs losers, depending on where the ♣A is. With 9 trump, South will play for the <span class="red">♥Q</span> to drop.	20250502_1.png
Q7	5/2/2025	South trumps the opening lead. She then leads a small heart to the <span class="red">♥K</span>. What is next?	South ruff another spade -- she has plenty of trump. South plays the <span class="red">♥A</span> and the last 2 fall. South can try to promote the <span class="red">♦T</span> to pitch a club.	20250502_1.png
Q8	5/2/2025	How should the declarer play the diamonds?	South leads a small diamond to the <span class="red">♦K</span>, and the <span class="red">♦3</span> back toward the <span class="red">♦A</span>. She is thinking about whether to finesse for the <span class="red">♦J</span>, when it falls on the second round. South discards a club on the 4th diamond.	20250502_1.png
Q9	5/2/2025	Does the contract make?	Yes, with 2 overtricks. If N-S had gotten to 6H, then West might have started with a club lead and setting the slam. 	20250502_1.png

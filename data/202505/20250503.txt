Q1	5/3/2025	South deals and passes. How should West open the bidding?	1D. West has just enough HCP to open. 1D promises 4 diamonds, playing "standard" minors.	20250503_1.png
Q2	5/3/2025	Bidding: 1D. North will pass. How should East respond to 1D?	1H. East sees 5 strong hearts, and openers plus. West would take 2H as a weak jump shift. Even playing a strong jump shift by responder, East is probably not quite there. 1H forces, and "We'll see about partner's rebid".	20250503_1.png
Q3	5/3/2025	Bidding: 1D, P, 1H. Should South overcall?	Yes, 1S. South has a hand that is barely in the 8-16 range, but the singleton adds some playing strength. 1S only promises 5 spades at the 1-level. It looks like spades is a good lead to suggest, should West be thinking NT.	20250503_1.png
Q4	5/3/2025	Bidding: 1D, P, 1H, 1S. Does West have a rebid?	Yes, 1NT. West's bid shows a minimum opener with a spade stopper (albeit not a great one).	20250503_1.png
Q5	5/3/2025	Bidding: 1D, P, 1H, 1S, 1NT, P. What should East rebid?	3NT. With East's 16 HCP, E-W have at least 28 HCP between them. That plenty for game, and never enough to look for slam. East has the ♠A and West has promised a stopper too. Time to go!	20250503_1.png
Q6	5/3/2025	All pass. 3NT in the West. What should North pick for the opening lead?	♠J. Setting up those long clubs is likely just a dream. North faithfully leads her partner's bid suit. The standard is to lead high from 2, and low from 3 or more.	20250503_1.png
Q7	5/3/2025	West sees the opening lead and the dummy hand. How should West plan the play?	The declarer counts winners in NoTrump. West counts 1 spade, 1 heart, 4 diamonds, and 1 club. West needs at least 1 extra heart. She will try to finesse the <span class="red">♥K</span> as soon as possible.	20250503_1.png
Q8	5/3/2025	West knows that 5 spades are in South from the bidding. Should West cover the opening ♠J?	Yes, play the ♠A. With the ♠AJ gone, West's ♠T is a stopper. The bridge saying "Play an honor on an honor" works out this time. West will come to hand in diamonds, and try the heart finesse.	20250503_1.png
Q9	5/3/2025	Does the contract make?	Yes, even though the finesse loses. West will get a second heart for sure for 9 tricks. South should exit in clubs or diamonds rather than promoting an added heart or spade trick for the declarer.	20250503_1.png

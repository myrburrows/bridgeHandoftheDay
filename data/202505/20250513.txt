Q1	5/13/2025	East deals. Should East open the bidding?	Yes, 1S. East has only 11 HCP, but she has opening Bergen 20 and LTC. East has 6 strong in the Master Suit. The spades are close to self-supporting, so South can add a little credit for the singleton. All in, not vulnerable, it is not really that much of a borderline call.	20250513_1.png
Q2	5/13/2025	Bidding: 1S. What should South overcall?	4D. South promises 8 diamonds and preemptive 6-10 HCP strength. South also factors in that opponents are bidding and that risks are down Not Vulnerable. South thinks that 2D (or 3D) does not value this hand the best.	20250513_1.png
Q3	5/13/2025	Bidding: 1S, 4D. How should West respond?	4S. West has spade support and an opening hand herself. West is not put off by the noise from South. Even if East has a weakish opener, there should be a reasonable play for game.	20250513_1.png
Q4	5/13/2025	Bidding: 1S, 4D, 4S. North and East will pass. Should South bid again?	Yes, 5D. South has only 1  trick in defense vs. 4S. So, South thinks E-W likely has a 420 score. If doubled, down 2 is 300 and down 3 is 500. Can South hold 5D to down 2? With 5 LTC, South just needs North to help a little. It is worth the risk.	20250513_1.png
Q5	5/13/2025	Bidding: 1S, 4D, 4S, P, P, 5D. What should West do now?	Double. West has 2 trump tricks and probably 2 clubs off the top, and East has opening count. There should be a nice penalty score for sure, versus a maybe 5S. East can go back to 5S if she wants.	20250513_1.png
Q6	5/13/2025	All Pass. 5D doubled, South declarer. What should West lead to start it?	♣A. There is a good chance that South is void in spades. West would like to capture two clubs off the top.	20250513_1.png
Q7	5/13/2025	South sees the opening lead and the dummy hand. How should South plan the play?	The declarer counts losers in a suit contract. There is a club loser and no spades. Missing only 3 trumps, there is a good chance that West has both <span class="red">♦A</span> and <span class="red">♦Q</span> for her double. So, South can only lose one heart to come out ahead.	20250513_1.png
Q8	5/13/2025	West won't lead the ♣K, as that would set up dummy's clubs. Should West switch to a spade or a heart?	<span class="red">♥3</span>. If East started with 7 spades (it seems very possible as unbalanced as things are), then South has no entry in dummy for the ♠A. It is risky to start hearts as well, as South must have some strength there. 	20250513_1.png
Q9	5/13/2025	South gets a free finesse of the <span class="red">♥J</span>. She will only lose one heart. How badly is South down?	2 down. South will try to finesse for the <span class="red">♦Q</span>, but West gets 2 trump tricks. The defense collects ♣A, <span class="red">♥A</span>, and 2 diamonds. South scores -300.	20250513_1.png
Q10	5/13/2025	Did South's gamble pay off?	Yes, 4S makes, as a losing club can be tossed after the marked diamond finesse. 4S loses only 2 hearts and the ♠A. -300 is better than -420.	20250513_1.png

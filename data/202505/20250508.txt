Q1	5/8/2025	East deals. East will pass. South will pass. What should West open?	1NT. West picks up a hand that is balanced. E - W have agreed to a 15-17 HCP range for 1NT, so West is at the top of the range.	20250508_1.png
Q2	5/8/2025	Bidding: P, P, 1NT. Should North overcall?	No, pass. North has the points but no 5+-card suit to name. Nevertheless, the hand looks useful for defense.	20250508_1.png
Q3	5/8/2025	Bidding: P, P, 1NT, P. How should East respond to 1NT?	2D. Bidding SAYC, East bids a Jacoby transfer. Her only feature is 5 hearts, so East plans to get her partner to say 2H. East will drop the bidding there, as there are not enough total points for likely game. West announces "Hearts" when East bids 2D.	20250508_1.png
Q4	5/8/2025	Bidding: P, P, 1NT, P, 2D, P. Should West super-accept her rebid to 3H?	Yes, bid 3H. West's super-size bid says "maximum HCP for NT and 4 of the major". West pushes East to bid game on any borderline hand.	20250508_1.png
Q5	5/8/2025	Bidding: P, P, 1NT, P, 2D, P, 3H, P. Should East continue to game?	No, pass. Allowing for 17 HCP in West, it still doesn't add up to game value with East's 4 HCP. 	20250508_1.png
Q6	5/8/2025	All Pass. 3H in the West. That is the value of the transfer as it keeps the strong hand hidden. What should North lead to start things?	♠A. Against a suit contract, A from AK is a recommended lead. North will get to see the dummy without taking much of a risk.	20250508_1.png
Q7	5/8/2025	West sees the opening ♠A and then the dummy hand. How should West plan the play?	The declarer counts losers in a suit contract. West sees 4 almost sure losers in the side suits. West has 9 trumps with the AK , and missing the <span class="red">♥Q</span>. It looks like trump have to behave to make 3H. "8 ever, 9 never".	20250508_1.png
Q8	5/8/2025	What should South play on the ♠A?	♠3. What sort of defensive signals do N - S use? Using just like/dislike signals, North just takes the ♠3 as discouraging. A more advanced pair would see this as a "preference signal" opportunity. Seeing the doubleton in East, South knows that her partner will switch suits to a minor after 2 rounds. Clubs or diamonds? The low spade calls for the lower side suit lead.	20250508_1.png
Q9	5/8/2025	North faithfully switches to clubs at trick 3. South collects the ♣A and returns diamonds toward weakness on the board. What happens next?	North wins the <span class="red">♦A</span>, and that is the first 4 tricks for the defense. North will exit in a minor. West now has winners and it comes down the the hearts. West leads the <span class="red">♥A</span> and then the <span class="red">♥2</span> toward the <span class="red">♥K</span> and <span class="red">♥J</span>.	20250508_1.png
Q10	5/8/2025	Does the contract make?	No. West does not finesse for the <span class="red">♥Q</span>, based on "9 never". The hand is so balanced that a singleton in South seems even less likely. But, the <span class="red">♥Q</span> collects trick #5 for the defense and it is down 1. 	20250508_1.png

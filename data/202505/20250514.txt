Q1	5/14/2025	West deals and passes. What should North open?	1NT. North has a balanced hand with 15 HCP, and a stopper in each suit. 	20250514_1.png
Q2	5/14/2025	Bidding: P, 1NT. East will pass. How should South respond?	? This is down to partnership agreements. If  N-S have no conventions for this case, South must pass. N-S here have an agreement for a 6+-card minor and a very weak hand. South thinks the hand will play better in 3D than 1NT. South bids 2S, an artificial relay to 3C. North must announce it!	20250514_1.png
Q3	5/14/2025	Bidding: P, 1NT, P, 2S, P. What does North rebid?	3C. South is the captain of the bidding now, and North does what she was ordered to do.	20250514_1.png
Q4	5/14/2025	Bidding: P, 1NT, P, 2S, P, 3C, P. What does South say on her rebid?	3D. If the long minor were clubs, South would pass and North would be the declarer. As it is, South bids 3D. By their agreement, North will leave it there.	20250514_1.png
Q5	5/14/2025	All Pass. 3D, and the declarer is South. What should West lead?	♣A. West decides on the ♣A, expecting to follow with the ♣5. West is not keen to underlead her honors in the majors. West doubts that a trump lead will cut ruffs from the dummy's balanced hand.	20250514_1.png
Q6	5/14/2025	South sees the opening lead, and then the dummy hand. How should South plan the play?	The declarer counts losers in a suit contract. South will lose a spade and a heart. With the ♣A lead, there are still 2 club losers. South sees that the trump will have to split 2-2, or she must develop a sluff somehow.	20250514_1.png
Q7	5/14/2025	West wins the ♣A, and lead the ♣5. How should South play it?	By the leads, South can be sure that East has the ♣Q. The finesse is pointless so South wins the ♣K. South leads 2 rounds of trump, but West started with 3. Nevertheless, a path to success for South has emerged.	20250514_1.png
Q8	5/14/2025	What should South lead after the <span class="red">♦A</span> and <span class="red">♦K</span>?	A club. East can win the ♣Q and West can sluff. If East leads clubs herself or switches to a major, a club lead is coming soon. South will pitch a major suit loser on dummy's last good club. West can trump or not, it does not matter to South.	20250514_1.png
Q9	5/14/2025	Does the 3D contract make?	Yes. South loses a trump, 2 clubs and 1 in a major suit. South found a home for her extra loser in clubs.	20250514_1.png

Q1	5/7/2025	North deals. What should North open?	1C. North has a minimum opening count. The spades are not long enough, and 1NT is not there.	20250507_1.png
Q2	5/7/2025	Bidding: 1C. Does East overcall?	? It's a good question. Clubs is the only biddable suit, forget a takeout double or 1NT with those hearts. How would West understand 2C? If E - W play Michaels, a 2C cuebid is wrong. If they play Michaels only for majors, then 2C (showing a 1C opener) is fine. Here, E - W do not have any agreement for a 2-level cuebid. East should pass.	20250507_1.png
Q3	5/7/2025	Bidding: 1C, P. South must pass. What should West overcall?	1H. West has plenty for a 1-level overcall (8-16 HCP), a 6-card major, and is in the balancing chair to boot.	20250507_1.png
Q4	5/7/2025	Bidding: 1C, P, P, 1H. Should North bid again?	Yes, 1S. North gets a chance to show her 4-card major (and minimum opener) at the 1-level. Even though her partner has shown a bust hand, South might have 4 spades.	20250507_1.png
Q5	5/7/2025	Bidding: 1C, P, P, 1H, 1S. How should East advance from 1H?	2C. Advancing to the 2-level, East shows 10+ HCP and 5+ good clubs. West will understand why she didn't hear from East on the first bidding round.	20250507_1.png
Q6	5/7/2025	Bidding: 1C, P, P, 1H, 1S, 2C, P. What should West rebid?	2H. West promises 6 hearts (or 5 very strong), and that 1H was a minimum-range overcall. 	20250507_1.png
Q7	5/7/2025	All Pass. 2H in the West. What should North pick for an opening lead?	6♠. North has likely 3 trump tricks as long as she does not lead them. She doesn't want to under-lead her honors in clubs or diamonds. At least North has some "body cards" in spades.	20250507_1.png
Q8	5/7/2025	West sees the ♠6 opening lead, and then the dummy hand. How should West plan the play?	The declarer counts loser in a suit bid. West is missing 3 of 4 top trumps so counts that a 3 losers. Yikes. West has a loser in spades, no diamonds and 1 club. It looks best to just lead trump every time on lead.	20250507_1.png
Q9	5/7/2025	East wins the second spade in the dummy, and leads the <span class="red">♥2</span>. What happens then?	West has her <span class="red">♥K</span> swallowed by the <span class="red">♥A</span>. North cannot lead anything to harm the contract.	20250507_1.png
Q10	5/7/2025	Does the contract make?	Yes, it goes as West expected. She loses 3 hearts and the black aces. It makes 8 tricks.	20250507_1.png

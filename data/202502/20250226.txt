1	2/26/2025	How should East start the bidding?	1C. East has a flat shape with opening HCP.  EW plays SAYC with strict 5+-card suit to open a major  Playing "standard minors", 1C only promises 3 of them.	20250226_1.png
2	2/26/2025	Bidding: 1C. South will Pass.  How should West respond?	1H. West is light on HCP, but has shape with 5-cards in each major suit.  The HCP range for a 1-over-1 response is 6 to anything and forcing. With equal suits in overcalls and responses, we bid up-the-ladder.	20250226_1.png
3	2/26/2025	Bidding: 1C, P, 1H. Should North get involved in the bidding?	Yes, 2D.  The 2-over-1 overcall promises 10 HCP so North is a little light. However, North has only 7 LTC and Diamonds is the best opening lead.  North pushes it.	20250226_1.png
4	2/26/2025	Bidding: 1C, P, 1H, 2D.  What should East say now?	3H. Partner has hit one of our 4-card suits.  With very good trump and 15 points (with the doubleton), East invites West to game with the "limit raise".	20250226_1.png
5	2/26/2025	Bidding: 1C, P, 1H, 2D, 3H. Shoud South reply to his Partner's overcall?	Pass. South would bid 3D over 2H, but the hand does not have the size or shape to try 4D when vulnerable.	20250226_1.png
6	2/26/2025	Bidding: 1C, P, 1H, 2D, 3H, P.  What should West bid now?	3S. The West hand re-evaluates to 11 points, EW has found a fit in Hearts.  West could just bid 4H and be done with it.  But it is possible that East has better Spades than Hearts. 3S is forcing and asks East to choose which major.	20250226_1.png
7	2/26/2025	Bidding: 1C, P, 1H, 2D, 3H, P, 3S, P. Which major should East choose?	4S.  Partner has shown equal suits, and there are 2 honors in the Spades.	20250226_1.png
8	2/26/2025	All Pass. 4S in the West.  What is the opening lead by North?	Ace of Diamonds. It is nothing creative, but best to try to get what Diamond tricks there are off the top. The Ace holds and North tries the Kind of Diamonds.	20250226_1.png
9	2/26/2025	Does the game in Spades make?	Yes. West loses a Diamond and then will trump.  There are 3 finesses to take, and it is down 1 if all 3 lose. Start with the trump finesse for the King.  If it loses, maybe South will return somethiing helpful.	20250226_1.png
10	2/26/2025	What should South play after taking the King of Spades?	South can look at dummy and see the Hearts and Clubs.  South does not want to lead toward those.  A Diamond lead would be a ruff and sluff.  South must lead a Spade.  Even so, West has it made when the Queen of Hearts doubleton falls.  Declarer loses 1 Diamond, 1 Club and 1 trump	20250226_1.png

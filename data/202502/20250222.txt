1	2/21/2025	Should West open the bidding?  Should North open the bidding?	No.  Both are balanced hands with < 10 HCP.	new_slide1.png
2	2/21/2025	There are 2 passes to her. Should East open?	For: Strong 6-card Diamonds, only 6 LTC, singleton Ace!, Bergen 20 and third chair. Against: Only 10 HCP and Vulnerable. Verdict: Open 1D	new_slide1.png
3	2/21/2025	Bids: P,P,1D. It's a very strong hand in South, so South will overcall with something.  What?	Double for takeout. 2C is viable but under-rates the overall strength.	new_slide1.png
4	2/21/2025	Bids: P, P, 1D, X. Should West get involved after South's Takeout Double?	No.  West has tolerance for Diamonds, if North should pass, and no biddable suit of her own.	new_slide1.png
5	2/21/2025	Bids: P,  P, 1D, X, P. How should North bid in response to the Takeout Double?	Partner has asked for the longest and strongest.  Less than 10 HCP so it is 1H.	new_slide1.png
6	2/21/2025	Bids: P,  P, 1D, X, P, 1H. Should East rebid the Diamonds?	Yes.  The Diamonds are rebiddable, so 2D.  . Partner is unlikely to be blank, based on North's weak bid.	new_slide1.png
7	2/21/2025	Bids: P,  P, 1D, X, P, 1H, 2D. Should South bid again or just pass and expect to defend against 2D?	South is not very confident that 2D will go down. The hand is strong enough to risk 2H, even if North only has 4 of them.	new_slide1.png
8	2/21/2025	Bids: P,  P, 1D, X, P, 1H, 2D, 2H. West and North will pass.  Should East bid again?	No.  Bidding 2D with no help from West was risky enough, especially Vulnerable. Passed out,	new_slide1.png
9	2/21/2025	The contract is 2H in the North.  What is the opening lead and why?	KD.  The King lead promises the Queen too. West is unlikely to have the Ace. But maybe put declarer in a bind with Diamonds if trump are tight.. The singleton Ace is usually good, but with 4 trumps, South does not really desire a ruff.	new_slide1.png
10	2/21/2025	As North, what is your line of play?  Will 2H make it?	North can take the Diamond Ace, and drive out the Ace of Clubs. The maximum tricks for E/W are 1 Ace, King of Spades, 2 trumps tricks and a Club ruff.. North makes 2H in a breeze, and more likely 3H if the defense is less than perfect.	new_slide1.png

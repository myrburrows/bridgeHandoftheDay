1	2/23/2025	Should East open the bidding?	East choices are Pass, 1D, or 2D.  In spite of only 6 LTC, the hand looks more preemptive than an opening "1" bid.  Start with 2D.	20250223_1.png
2	2/23/2025	Bidding: 2D. Should South overcall?	There is strength in highly distributional hands.  If it is "5 - 5 come alive", then it is moreso for 6-5.  Another Spade honor would be nice, but a weak-2 overcall (not vulnerable) does not promise a lot. Bid 2S.	20250223_1.png
3	2/23/2025	Bidding: 2D, 2S. West has a strong, balanced hand.  What bid?	Double. West has not bid a suit, so East will understand that this is for takeout of some kind.  The bid will force East to bid.  If East bids 3D, that's OK.  If Partner shows some outside strength, maybe 3NT?	20250223_1.png
4	2/23/2025	Bidding: 2D, 2S, X. Should North get in on the action?	Yes, bid 3S.  N/S have 10 Spades between them.  The single raise of a takeout Double is preemptive, so Partner should not get over-excited.  The "Law of Total Tricks" is at least an indicator for the bid.	20250223_1.png
5	2/23/2025	Bidding: 2D, 2S, X, 3S.  Does East have a bid here?	Pass. It would be nice to show the Ace of Hearts, but the bidding has gone too high.  	20250223_1.png
6	2/23/2025	Bidding: 2D, 2S, X, 3S, P.  Will South raise to game?	Yes, 4S. The short red suits are looking strong.  North's bid likely showed 4 Spades, since she chose to bid.  A very distributional hand and not vulnerable, it should have a fighting chance.	20250223_1.png
7	2/23/2025	Bidding: 2D, 2S, X, 3S, P, 4S.  What should West say now?	Pass.  It looks like a good defensive hand.  West's hand is balanced, but it seems everybody else is lopsided. Doubling for penalty seems unwise. 5D does not seem likely, and maybe expensive vulnerable.  	20250223_1.png
8	2/23/2025	All pass.  West is on-lead against 4S.  What opening lead?	Ace of Diamonds. West knows where the KQ are so it should be harmless. West hopes Diamonds are split 2-1 and cash a Diamond trick before the singleton is pitched somewhere	20250223_1.png
9	2/23/2025	Declarer will trump the opening Diamond.  What is South's line of play?	It is pretty simple.  First lead a small Heart toward the KQ.  The defense cannont return anything to hurt the contract.  Commence the cross-ruff.	20250223_1.png
10	2/23/2025	Will declarer make her 10 tricks?	Yes, comfortably.  A Heart, a Club, and 8 (or 9) Spade tricks are there.	20250223_1.png

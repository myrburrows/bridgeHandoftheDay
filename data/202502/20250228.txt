1	2/28/2025	How should East start the bidding?	1H.  With 16 HCP and a 5-card major, East should open 1H.  East could consider 1NT with this shape, but there are 2 suits with no stopper.	20250228_1.png
2	2/28/2025	Bidding: 1H.  What does South do?	2S.  South has 6 Spades with the top two.  The hand is borderline too strong for a preempt, and might open 1S if first-to-bid. With East already showing strength, there is incentive to try to cutoff the opponents.	20250228_1.png
3	2/28/2025	Bidding: 1H, 2S.  Should West raise to 3H?	No, Pass.  The singleton, the Ace, and the trump support might tempt West.  But the West hand is about a King short of encouraging partner at the 3-level.	20250228_1.png
4	2/28/2025	Bidding: 1H, 2S, P. Is North able to bid here?	Yes, 3S.  North has a respectable hand with strong Clubs.  There are 4 trumps, and so there are 10 trumps in NS. The Law of Total Tricks urges a bid, even with this unbecoming 4-3-3-3 shape.	20250228_1.png
5	2/28/2025	Bidding: 1H, 2S, P, 3S. East must Pass. Can South go to game in Spades?	Yes, 4S. North must have some money for the raise. The Diamonds seem a little better now, and the short Hearts and Clubs may help out.  Not vulnerable, South will go fot it.	20250228_1.png
6	2/28/2025	All Pass. 4S in the South. What does West lead?	H5, East's suit. The guideline, for leading Partner's bid suit, is to lead low from 3 or more, and the highest from two.  	20250228_1.png
7	2/28/2025	Plan the play for South	Declarer cannot avoid losing 2 Hearts and the Ace of Diamonds.  South expects to pick up all the Spades. The game will come down to not losing a trick to the Jack of Diamonds.  	20250228_1.png
8	2/28/2025	After losing 2 Hearts, trumping, and pulling Spades, how should South attack Diamonds?	The general rule is that missing honors are in the hand that bid.  South will cross to Dummy in Clubs and lead the 10 of Diamonds.  A nervous East might cover, but should play low.  It is only a little better than a guess, but if South plays low the Ace will appear.	20250228_1.png
9	2/28/2025	Does Declarer make 10 tricks?	The answer is Yes, if South guesses the Diamonds right.	20250228_1.png

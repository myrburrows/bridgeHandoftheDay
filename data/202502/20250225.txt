1	2/25/2025	How should South start the bidding?	1S. South has a very strong hand with only 4 LTC.  The hand is not strong enough for opening 2C, but start 1S.  South will be happy to push forward, given the chance.	20250225_1.png
2	2/25/2025	Bidding: 1S. West will Pass.  How does North respond to 1S?	2S.  North lacks high-card strength and any useful shape. She is happy to have a fouth Spade for Partner.	20250225_1.png
3	2/25/2025	Bidding: 1S, P, 2S.  Can East get into the bidding?	3H. The 6 Hearts are pretty good. The hand is a bit weak for the bid but not vulnerable and we interfere if we can.  If South passes, South must be minimal and West will have some money.  If South bids, then Hearts is a good lead-directing suit.	20250225_1.png
4	2/25/2025	Bidding: 1S, P, 2S, 3H.  What should South bid now?	4S.  North's bid shows 6-10 HCP and at least 3 Spades.  The singleton Heart now re-evaluates to 3 points for a total of 22.  The hand should have a strong shot at game.	20250225_1.png
5	2/25/2025	Bidding: 1S, P, 2S, 3H, P, 4S, All Pass. What should West lead against 4S?	West is for sure leading Hearts.  Suspecting that South will be short or void in Hearts (since East bid 3 of them), in the tournament West led the Queen of Hearts.	20250225_1.png
6	2/25/2025	How should South plan the play?	Start with counting losers.  Declarer is missing 2 Aces.  It looks like 1 sure loser in Diamonds and a second loser there if the King is offside.  More thinking ...	20250225_1.png
7	2/25/2025	For Declarer, where is the "danger hand"?  What is the "danger suit" and why?	The "danger hand" is East because East will surely lead Diamonds toward the weakness on the board.  Can Declarer keep East from leading Diamonds twice? Sure! South can duck the Heart Queen on trick #1.	20250225_1.png
8	2/25/2025	How will Declarer avoid losing a fourth trick?	Whatever West leads on trick #2, South will soon be on lead to pull trump and setup Clubs. East will only be on lead one time to lead Diamonds and South will just take the Ace.  The possible second Diamond loser gets thrown off on a Club.	20250225_1.png
9	2/25/2025	Does the game in Spades make?	Yes, with careful play, and a little help from the opening lead.  	20250225_1.png

1	2/24/2025	How should South start the bidding?	This is a strong hand with 6 Spades, the singleton and 16 HCP. It is not strong enough for 2 Clubs.  Open 1S and await developments.	20250224_1.png
2	2/24/2025	Bidding: 1S. West will Pass.  How does North respond?	N/S bid SAYC, including the Jacoby 2NT convention.  A response of 2NT (artificial) would show 4+ Spades with game-forcing strength.  This matches North perfectly, so 2NT.	20250224_1.png
3	2/24/2025	Bidding: 1S, P. North's response, part 2.  	Note that North is stuck for a good response without the Jacoby 2NT convention. North's hand is too strong for 2S and too strong for 3S too.  3S is invitational and might get passed.  4S means weak with 5+ Spades.	20250224_1.png
4	2/24/2025	Bidding: 1S, P, 2NT. East will Pass.  What should South rebid?	Playing Jacoby 2NT, South can show a short suit (void or singleton) if she has one.  Bid 3H.	20250224_1.png
5	2/24/2025	Bidding: 1S, P, 2NT, P, 3H, P.  What should North rebid?	4S. This is a little counter-intuitive but South would think 3S is fishing around for more information.  North does not have any extra strength or shape, and that is what 4S tells South.	20250224_1.png
6	2/24/2025	Bidding: 1S, P, 2NT, P, 3H, P, 4S, P.  What should South do now?	4NT. South has extras.  South will use the Blackwood convention to find out if North has the Ace of Hearts.  If Yes, South will try for 6S and otherwise stop at 5S.	20250224_1.png
7	2/24/2025	Bidding: 1S, P, 2NT, P, 3H, P, 4S, P, 4NT, P.  How should North respond to Blackwood?	5D. N/S play plain-vanilla Blackwood. No Aces = 5C, 1 Ace = 5D and so forth.	20250224_1.png
8	2/24/2025	Bidding: 1S, P, 2NT, P, 3H, P, 4S, P, 4NT, P, 5D, P. What will South's rebid be now?	6S!  South found the missing Ace in Partner's hand.  Let's go for it.	20250224_1.png
9	2/24/2025	All Pass. What is West's opening lead?	Jack of Diamonds.  It's the top of an honor series.	20250224_1.png
10	2/24/2025	Plan the play of the hand.  Will declarer make the Small Slam?	South has 2 losers -- a Club and a Diamond.  South can try the Heart finesse but will always lose a Diamond too if it fails. But South should first try the indirect finesse toward the Queen of Clubs.  If the King is in the West, an extra Club trick appears to save the slam.  If Clubs fail, South tries the Hearts.	20250224_1.png

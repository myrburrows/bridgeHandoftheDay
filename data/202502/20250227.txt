1	2/27/2025	How should South start the bidding?	1H.  South has openers+ for HCP, and a 5-card major.	20250227_1.png
2	2/27/2025	Bidding: 1H. West has a good hand but no 5-card suit. The hand is the wrong shape for a takeout double. Pass from West. How should North respond?	2H. North has 3 Hearts and can support. The hand is in the 6-10 point range for a 2-level response.	20250227_1.png
3	2/27/2025	Bidding: 1H, P, 2H. There will be no bidding from East.  What should South's rebid be?	4H.  The singleton Club re-evaluates to 3 points, based on the Heart fit.  The hand is someplace above 20 points, and will have a play for game even if North has the minimum.	20250227_1.png
4	2/27/2025	All Pass. 4H in the South.  What is the opening lead by West?	The Ace of Clubs is both safe and aggressive.  West will plan to continue Clubs, up to 3 rounds if possible.	20250227_1.png
5	2/27/2025	What is the plan of play for the Declarer?	Things look pretty rosy.  South expects to lose a Club, trump a Club, pull trump, take the Diamond finesse, and finally the Spade finesse.  Worst case: making 10 tricks.	20250227_1.png
6	2/27/2025	West leads 2 rounds of Clubs and South trumps the second. South leads the Ace of Hearts, and then the low Heart to the Queen.  East shows out!  Now what for South?	Yikes! South cannot pull trump, as EW will run Clubs if they get in.  South should start with the Diamond finesse.  South will still be on Easy Street if the Queen is onside.  	20250227_1.png
7	2/27/2025	West takes the Queen of Diamonds and leads the third round of Clubs.  What should South do now?	South has lost 2 tricks already and will lose control of Hearts if she trumps in.  South should just cooly throw the S4 here.  Dummy can ruff a 4th round of Clubs and South can return to hand with the King of Spades.  Then, she can pull trump and claim. Any switch by West is fine too.	20250227_1.png
8	2/27/2025	Does the contract make?	Yes. There was a bad split in trumps but escape was possible.  South loses 2 Clubs and a Diamond only.	20250227_1.png
